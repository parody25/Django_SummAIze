    "financial_analysis": {
        "ratios": "",
        "analysis": "### 1. Current Ratio Analysis\n\nThe current ratio for the borrower stands at 1.5, indicating a healthy liquidity position. This ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. \n\n- **Trade Receivables and Payables**: \n  - Trade receivables have decreased from AED 17,255,072 in 2023 to AED 15,484,276 in 2024, marking a decrease of approximately 10.3%. This reduction suggests improved collection efficiency or a decrease in sales on credit.\n  - Trade payables have increased from AED 14,737,470 in 2023 to AED 17,570,826 in 2024, representing a 19.2% increase. This could indicate extended credit terms from suppliers or increased purchasing activity.\n\n- **Due Within 12 Months vs. After 12 Months**:\n  - The financial statements do not explicitly break down the amounts due within 12 months versus after 12 months for trade receivables and payables. However, given the nature of these accounts, they are typically expected to be settled within the operating cycle, usually within 12 months.\n\n- **Bad Debts or Impairments**:\n  - There is no specific mention of bad debts or impairments in the current year versus the previous year in the provided data. However, the decrease in trade receivables could imply effective management of credit risk or write-offs of uncollectible accounts.\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio Analysis\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is 0.4, indicating a conservative capital structure with a higher reliance on equity financing.\n\n- **Components of Loans and Borrowings**:\n  - Total borrowings have decreased from AED 12,271 Mn in 2023 to AED 9,686 Mn in 2024, a reduction of AED 2,585 Mn or approximately 21.1%.\n  - The decrease in borrowings suggests repayments have been made, possibly from operating cash flows or refinancing activities.\n\n- **Loan Instruments**:\n  - The specific loan instruments that have changed are not detailed in the provided data. However, the overall reduction in borrowings indicates a strategic move to reduce debt levels.\n\n- **New Loans or Repayments**:\n  - The significant decrease in total borrowings suggests that repayments have been prioritized over taking new loans. This could be part of a strategy to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce interest obligations.\n\n### 3. Interest Coverage Ratio Analysis\n\nThe interest coverage ratio is calculated at 21, indicating a strong ability to cover interest expenses from operating profits.\n\n- **Finance Costs**:\n  - Finance costs have decreased from AED 1,039,466 in 2023 to AED 940,914 in 2024, a reduction of approximately 9.5%.\n  - This decrease in finance costs, coupled with a strong operating profit, enhances the borrower\u2019s ability to service debt.\n\n- **Implications on Debt Servicing**:\n  - The high interest coverage ratio suggests that the borrower is well-positioned to meet its interest obligations, providing a buffer against potential financial stress.\n\n### 4. Total Revenue (Growth) Analysis\n\nThe total revenue for the borrower increased from AED 26,750 Mn in 2023 to AED 35,505 Mn in 2024, marking a significant growth of 32%.\n\n- **Revenue Breakdown**:\n  - The revenue is primarily driven by the real estate segment, with significant contributions from leasing and retail activities.\n  - Revenue from external customers over a period of time increased from AED 21,089,066 in 2023 to AED 30,089,672 in 2024.\n  - Revenue recognized at a point in time decreased slightly, indicating a shift towards longer-term contracts or projects.\n\n- **Component\u2019s Share in Total Revenue**:\n  - The real estate segment remains the largest contributor to total revenue, followed by leasing and retail activities. This diversification across segments provides stability and reduces reliance on a single revenue stream.\n\nOverall, the borrower demonstrates a strong financial position with robust liquidity, a conservative capital structure, and a solid ability to service debt. The significant revenue growth further underscores the borrower\u2019s operational strength and market position."

        "risk_rating": "### Risk Analysis Commentary for Emaar Properties\n\n#### Credit Score Trend Analysis and Industry Comparison\nOver the past eight months, Emaar Properties has demonstrated a fluctuating credit score trend, with scores ranging from a low of 13 in July 2024 to a high of 65 in December 2024. The current score stands at 60, indicating a low to medium risk level. This is a significant improvement from the previous months, particularly from the low scores observed in the earlier part of the period. When compared to the average scores of all scored companies and those within the same industry, Emaar Properties consistently outperformed, especially in the last three months. The industry average has remained relatively stable around 47-48, while Emaar's score has shown a positive upward trend, suggesting improved creditworthiness relative to its peers.\n\n#### Financial Stability Risk Analysis\nEmaar Properties has been assigned a Financial Stability Risk Rating of 1, which places it in the low-risk category. This rating suggests a minimal likelihood of payment default or bankruptcy within the next 12 months. The company's strong financial stability is further supported by its long-standing presence in the industry, with over 28 years in business, and its diversified operations across multiple subsidiaries and regions.\n\n#### Days Beyond Terms (DBT) Analysis\nThe current DBT for Emaar Properties is 60 days, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 15 days. This indicates that the company is paying its bills considerably later than the typical industry timeframe. Over the past eight months, there has been a noticeable increase in DBT from 0 days in the earlier months to the current 60 days. This trend suggests a potential liquidity issue or a strategic decision to extend payment terms, which could impact supplier relationships if not managed carefully.\n\n#### Payment Trend Analysis\nThe payment trend for Emaar Properties has shown some variability over the last six months. The company maintained a high current payment percentage, ranging from 94% to 100%, with minimal amounts falling into the 31-60 DBT category. However, the recent increase in DBT to 60 days indicates a declining payment trend, as the company is taking longer to settle its debts. This shift from a previously stable payment pattern could be a cause for concern if it continues, as it may affect the company's credit reputation and supplier trust.\n\n#### Legal Judgements\nThere is one pending legal judgment against Emaar Properties, filed on 11th March 2015 in Dubai, with a liability amount of AED 2,675. Although the amount is relatively small, the existence of a legal judgment could potentially impact the company's credit profile and should be addressed to prevent any negative implications on future credit assessments.\n\nIn summary, while Emaar Properties shows a strong financial stability risk rating and an improving credit score trend, the increase in DBT and the presence of a legal judgment warrant attention. Addressing these issues will be crucial for maintaining the company's creditworthiness and financial health."

The Central Bank of the UAE maintained its GDP growth forecast at 4% for 2024, up from 3.6% in 2023, primarily driven by non-oil sectors such as tourism, transportation, construction, real estate, financial, and insurance services. Capitalising on this favourable environment, we delivered exceptional performance across our key segments in 2024. We achieved AED 70 billion in property sales, marking a 72% y-o-y growth and reinforcing our leadership in the UAE's real estate sector. Our revenue grew by 33% y-o-y to AED 35.5 billion, driven by robust real estate sales and the continued success of our mall, retail and hospitality assets. Our balance sheet remains strong, with a cash position of AED 50 billion, bolstering our future growth potential.\n\n# ABOUT US\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nJamal Bin Theniyah\n\nChairman\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2645, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30e98fa5-136a-4e14-9cfc-f020808afb9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "30e98fa5-136a-4e14-9cfc-f020808afb9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7f6643a-8339-48b4-b4f6-ba16ed3b1d76", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b985d8fa10d9c04c9c2d4a39e8f1bdd874aff632bb1f186f7fbe252e4a10ce1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT THE REPORT\n\n# WE ARE EMAAR\n\n# CHAIRMAN\u2019S MESSAGE\n\n# YEAR IN REVIEW\n\n# MANAGING DIRECTOR\u2019S STATEMENT\n\n# ABOUT US\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nrenewable energy adoption, and secured sustainable urban development is unwavering.

The D33 Agenda targets 7\u20138 million by 2033 through visa reforms, business-friendly policies, and infrastructure development, ensuring sustained demand for housing and commercial properties, and solidifying real estate as a key driver of Dubai\u2019s economic growth.\n\nDubai\u2019s residential market maintained strong momentum in 2024, driven by population growth coupled with significant growth in property prices and rental rates. In 2024, Dubai\u2019s property market saw a nearly 20% rise in average prices, with apartment prices up 19% to AED 1,610 per sq. ft. and villa prices up 23% to AED 1,980 per sq. ft. A supply shortage in sought-after areas is expected to push rents higher.

Average retail rents increased y-o-y by nearly 3% in Dubai from higher base and over 8% in Abu Dhabi, where rates for premium centres like Dubai Mall exceeded AED 700 per sq. ft. JLL reports that during 2024, retail stock in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi remained stable at 4.8 million sq. m. and 3.2 million sq. m., respectively. New retail developments are expected to add 58,000 sq. m. of retail space in Dubai and 85,000 sq. m. in Abu Dhabi, in 2025 mostly in community and regional malls.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# Strong Growth in Hospitality\n\nAligned with UAE\u2019s Attractiveness1,2 Dubai and Abu Dhabi attract millions of global visitors annually for business and leisure, resulting in strong demand for high-end hospitality services. The UAE is also a leading destination for business and meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE), with world-class conference facilities and exhibition centres. Both Dubai and Abu Dhabi witnessed strong growth across key performance indicators, with resilient ADR and RevPAR growth. According to JLL, visitor numbers remained strong, with Dubai recording\u00b3 over 18.72 million visitors between January to December 2024 vs 17.15 million between January to December 2023, marking an 9% increase. Dubai is on track to reach its goal of 23-25 million visitors by 2025. Passenger traffic at Dubai Airport also surged, to ~92 million passengers in 2024.\n\n# Key International Markets\n\nEgypt is focused on macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility and financing from the World Bank and EU. Despite March 2024\u2019s monetary tightening and exchange rate adjustment easing the foreign currency crisis, ongoing Middle East tensions, though coming to resolution, continue to affect foreign income, especially Suez Canal revenues. Despite these economic challenges, Egypt\u2019s real estate sectors demonstrated resilience, with all major segments stable or growing in 2024. According to Mordor Intelligence, Egypt\u2019s residential real estate market is expected to sustain its momentum, driven by favourable economic conditions, increasing disposable income and a resilient homebuyer demand. Supported by stable interest rates, a moderated inflation outlook, and the government\u2019s commitment to housing for all, demand is expected to remain strong across segments. 2024 sales reached an 11-year high with 0.2 million units, marking an 11% y-o-y growth.\n\n# FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n|Projected growth of residential real estate market (CAGR) in Egypt by 2029|11%|\n|---|---|\n|y-o-y growth in sales in Egypt|35%|\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n1 Source: UAE Real Estate Market Review Q4 2024, CBRE\n\n2 Source: Dubai Retail Market Dynamics, Q3 2024, JLL\n\n3 Source: Dubai Government Tourism Performance Report Jan-Dec 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3102, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92daa90a-a26e-4c0f-a246-fa80a2569547": {"__data__": {"id_": "92daa90a-a26e-4c0f-a246-fa80a2569547", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf760e46-3f0d-4c07-a43f-b9050d933221", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4524240c90e1acfee9313b6858d3914a55d31ced422a79bd59b2ce34ff262cea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Sustained Growth Momentum\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nWe continued to deliver robust financial performance, driven by robust demand in Dubai and our key markets, consistent project execution and steadily growing recurring revenue.

The medium-term reduction target is to reduce building-related emissions by 56%, by 2030. As Dubai\u2019s premier real estate developer, we are determined to play a key role in achieving the UAE\u2019s Net Zero 2050 Strategy.\n\nIn recognition of the urgency of this issue, we focused upon climate risk and mitigation at our Risk Committee meeting in September 2024. The Risk Committee endorsed the concern that climate change is an emerging risk to our business and sanctioned the development of proactive strategies to mitigate and adapt to these challenges. We also created a comprehensive emissions inventory in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, swiftly followed by the development of a climate change mitigation roadmap.\n\n# With respect to Scope 3\n\nWe are working through the various categories of emissions that are contextually important to our business operations and with stakeholders across our value chain to capture emissions data. Our rebased emissions for 2023 for UAE, India and Egypt are 722,462 tCO\u2082e. In 2024, across these three businesses, we emitted 774,698 tCO\u2082e marking a slight increase of 7% during the year. The increase may be attributed to a more comprehensive data set from Emaar Community Management in the UAE, as well as our expanding asset base across all businesses.\n\n# Scope 2 GHG emissions\n\nScope 2 GHG emissions are rebased in alignment with the increased coverage of the inventory. The UAE is responsible for 93% of our Scope 2 carbon emissions, making India and Egypt 7% of our total Scope 2 footprint. As we advance our plans to combat climate change in 2025, we will continue to implement actions identified in our climate change roadmap.\n\n# Scope 1 emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions across the UAE, India, and Egypt, associated with stationary, mobile, and fugitive sources, totalled 13,373 tCO\u2082e, in 2024.

This includes prohibiting forced and child labour across our value chains. As our primary operations exist within the UAE, our existing policies and procedures reflect relevant, applicable UAE laws and protection.\n\n# Data Privacy and Security\n\nAs the shift towards digital systems accelerates, protecting and securing online data, and protecting the privacy of our customers and our broader stakeholders, is an ever-increasing material risk. We are committed to safeguarding consumer privacy and ensuring the highest standards of data security. Our comprehensive privacy policies empower individuals with transparency and control over their personal information, including rights to access, correct inaccuracies, and request data deletion or processing restrictions. Advanced technical and organisational measures are in place to prevent unauthorised access and mitigate data breach risks. This year, we can report our compliance with data privacy and security measures with no data breaches.\n\nTo stay ahead of emerging threats, we continuously update our policies and practices, aligning with evolving regulations and global standards. Technology risks are systematically assessed and reported to the Risk Committee, ensuring proactive management. Regular updates on threat landscapes and mitigation strategies enable informed decision-making to safeguard system integrity and operational continuity. We maintain our ISO 27001:2022 certification through annual surveillance audits, with a full recertification audit every three years. Regular information security audits are conducted by internal teams, external auditors, and government auditors.\n\n# ESG in Action\n\nA dedicated Human Rights Working Group is also in place as part of our ESG Governance structure to identify risk areas, and propose enhancements to mechanisms aimed at addressing human rights risks within Emaar\u2019s value chain.\n\n# Keeping Colleagues Safe in a Digital World\n\nTo identify vulnerabilities early and continually strengthen our overall cybersecurity, we regularly engage employees with cybersecurity awareness emails to ensure they remain well-informed about best practices and emerging threats. We also conduct phishing simulations and social engineering tests to evaluate employee awareness and their response to potential threats.\n\n# Information Security Management\n\nOur Cyber Security team oversees implementation of our IT security controls, ensuring all measures to safeguard sensitive information are properly deployed. In addition, we regularly engage external partners to conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify weaknesses in our systems, along with red teaming exercises that simulate advanced, targeted attacks to assess the effectiveness of our defences.\n\n# Corporate Governance Report\n\nWe conduct regular audits across financial operations, cybersecurity, data protection, and risk management.

This initiative represents a critical milestone in our efforts to quantify greenhouse gas emissions across key markets, enabling the establishment of measurable reduction targets and progress tracking over time. In September 2024, the Risk Committee formally identified climate change as an emerging risk to our business.\n\nPotential risks posed by climate change include operational disruptions from extreme weather events, increased regulatory costs, and shifts in consumer behaviour towards sustainable products. In 2024, we performed a preliminary analysis on the effects of April\u2019s torrential rains on Emaar. The analysis outlined steps taken to manage the situation and future actions to improve preparedness for similar climate challenges. The analysis was presented to the Risk Committee (comprised of Board members) in September 2024.

IMD, provided modules over several days for employees, while the Frontiers in Private Equity program at Oxford University offered an intensive multi-day course.\n\nHosted the H1 2024 Rally to recognise and celebrate employee contributions, dedication, and achievements, with employees across various levels being acknowledged and rewarded for their exceptional work.\n\nLaunched the Train the Trainer (TTT) program, which included multiple workshops and successfully certified employees as Master Trainers, capable of delivering product and technical training.\n\nRevamped the downtown learning academy to facilitate the launch of the EHG Orientation Program and any future classroom training sessions.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nIn 2024, the HR and People & Performance departments at Emaar embarked on a transformative journey, implementing a series of specialised programs and initiatives. This report highlights our innovative approach to talent development and organisational growth.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nGroup-Wide Talent Identification Framework: The Talent Identification Framework was implemented to support succession planning by classifying employees into three key categories:\n\n- Top Talent (Grade 9+): Employees ready for leadership roles.\n- High-Potential Talent (Grades 7-8): Future leaders in need of development.\n- Emerging Talent (Grades 4-6): Early-career employees with strong growth potential.\n\nThis framework provided a structured method for identifying and nurturing successors for critical roles.\n\nGroup Wide Critical Position Framework: The critical roles identification exercise required leaders to rate all Grade 7+ roles on a 3-point scale, including any critical technical roles below Grade 7. The process involved collaboration with N-1 and N-2, line managers to ensure a role-centric evaluation. A final calibration ensured alignment on a well-justified list, with qualitative rationale provided for each critical role. The exercise was conducted with a selective approach, emphasising roles with the highest impact while maintaining confidentiality.\n\nTraining Needs Analysis: To build a robust group-level learning strategy, a centralised Training Needs Analysis was implemented for all Compliance and Technical Training. This initiative aimed to align training programs with regulatory requirements, enhance team skills, and maintain a competitive edge across the organisation.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Emiratisation timeline throughout 2024\n\nDuring 2024, significant strides were made in advancing Emiratisation efforts within our organisation. Key highlights include:\n\n- Launch of Graduate Trainee Programme 2.0: Building on the success of the initial program, we expanded our efforts by hiring 72 fresh graduate UAE nationals across the organisation. The program concluded in Q1 2024 with 31 Graduate Trainees confirmed as full-time employees.\n- The mentorship program aimed to enhance professional development by pairing mentors with mentees to boost skills, knowledge, and career growth at Emaar. Mentorship Program 2.0 included success criteria to measure the impact on both mentors and mentees. A total of 88 mentees and 17 mentors participated in the program.\n- Organised the LeaderShift workshop for mentors and high-potential expats, certified by Maxwell Leadership, with a significant number of participants earning certification.\n- The CFA Program has been introduced at Emaar Academy as part of the development track to enhance financial skills among UAE Nationals. Out of 50 participants, 11 have successfully advanced to the CFA batch after passing the PRE-CFA assessment. The assessment is scheduled for May 2025, supporting Emaar\u2019s goal of building financial expertise within the organisation.\n- Participation in Ru\u2019ya Career Fair, the largest UAE national based career fair, where we successfully received over 1380 applicants.\n- As part of the International Exposure Program, selected UAE Nationals from Emaar Properties will undertake a 12-week assignment at Emaar India and Emaar Egypt. This initiative is designed to bridge key skill gaps by offering participants hands-on experience and valuable insights into the macro-economic environments, cultures, and real estate markets of India and Egypt. The program will also expose them to standardised operational practices, expand their professional networks, and enhance their project management capabilities. This experience will play a crucial role in developing a more globally aware and well-rounded workforce.\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4807, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21a90077-a194-4335-b32d-4d9bbe425448": {"__data__": {"id_": "21a90077-a194-4335-b32d-4d9bbe425448", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0829427-4870-49df-a47d-23b0098333d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4aa5e18e1fc2f382614cc27be5460c4884b4832a3c02d494dd099b2960d434be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Annex M\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nStatement of the Related Parties Transactions in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as listed in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year 2024\n\n| |2024|2023|\n|---|---|---|\n|Cost of revenue|4,362|4,245|\n|Property development expenses|-|11,230|\n|Other operating income|41,283|22,096|\n|Other income|17,764|16,485|\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe Group in the normal course of business enters into transactions with individuals and other entities that fall within the definition of related party.

In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and applicable the UAE Federal Law, AED 1,351 million is transferred to general reserve from the distributable profit of AED 13,514 million. The transfer to statutory reserve from the distributable profit has been suspended as the reserve has reached 50% of the paid-up share capital.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# Principal Activities\n\nThe principal activities of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2024 were property investment, development and development management, shopping malls and retail, hospitality, property management and utility services and investment in providers of financial services.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Our Performance in 2024\n\nEmaar has shown strong commitment to the development of Dubai\u2019s economy and the improvement of our society. Our contributions in all areas have been substantial and effective, driven by steady growth in the real estate market, recovery in travel and tourism, and trust in Emaar\u2019s leading brands. During the year the Group acquired 141 million square feet of development land in prime area in Dubai with a total development value of AED 96 billion. This strategic expansion aims to redefine luxurious living while fostering a greener future within Dubai\u2019s landscape.\n\nIn 2024, Emaar achieved group property sales of approximately AED 70 billion, marking a 72% increase compared to previous year and bolstering Group revenue backlog from property sales over AED 110 billion, including joint ventures. Furthermore, our diverse recurring revenue portfolio, comprising malls, hospitality, leisure, entertainment, and commercial leasing, witnessed remarkable growth, surpassing AED 9.3 billion in revenue, representing a growth of more than 8% from the previous year (excluding Namshi, sold in February 2023 and one-off revenue adjustment in 2023).\n\nNotably, our flagship asset, the Dubai Mall, welcomed a record 111 million visitors, an increase of around 6% compared to the previous year, making the mall the most visited place on Earth for the second consecutive year.\n\n# Outlook for 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, our strategic brand positioning and robust project pipeline promise sustained growth and success. Our substantial revenue backlog from property sales lays a strong foundation for future growth, reinforced by the robust performance of our recurring revenue businesses and our plans to further expand this segment. We remain committed to unveiling innovative projects and unparalleled offerings across all our business divisions.\n\nWe have long recognised our responsibility to both society and the environment, and over the years, we have taken various initiatives to integrate ESG principles into our operations. In 2024, the Group established a comprehensive sustainability strategy focused on resource use, waste management, water stewardship, and responsible sourcing. Through the implementation of this strategy, we will continue to promote environmental responsibility, working toward a sustainable future for our planet and the betterment of all our stakeholders.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3829, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "666065c5-5983-4e29-854b-1b1d2284d328": {"__data__": {"id_": "666065c5-5983-4e29-854b-1b1d2284d328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1541faf0-8757-453b-9388-14a7e89c9bf1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5961022f53a7737413d0bf5d9262e7e08cb19c2675ccf64831486dec298305fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Transactions with Related Parties\n\nThe consolidated financial statements disclose related party transactions and balances in note 33.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants\u2019 International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the United Arab Emirates, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# The key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group recognises revenue on sale of properties in accordance with IFRS 15 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and Lease income in accordance with IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d.\n\n- We have assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies adopted by the Group and its compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS Accounting Standards\u201d);\n- Obtained an understanding of the revenue process implemented by the Group;\n- We have performed test of design and implementation of relevant controls;\n- On a sample basis, we have assessed the contracts for sale of properties to identify the performance obligations of the Group under these contracts and assessed whether these performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time based on the criteria specified under IFRS 15;\n- On a sample basis, we have assessed the appropriateness of percentage of completion of the construction of properties by reference to costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total costs, where the performance obligation is satisfied over time;\n- On a sample basis, we have assessed the adequacy of the total estimated cost to complete through the management appointed external cost consultant\u2019s report, supporting agreements, retrospective evaluation of budgets and other relevant information.\n\nRental income from leased properties is recognised in accordance with the terms of the lease agreed with the tenants on a straight-line basis from the operating lease commencement date over the period of the lease. The lease agreements may include certain clauses relating to (i) lease income computed based on lessee turnover; and (ii) tenant incentives which may affect the amount of rental income recognised during the year.\n\nConsidering the inherent risks around the existence and accuracy, rental income from leased properties warrants additional audit focus.\n\n- On a sample basis, we tested lease agreements to ensure the existence and accuracy of the revenue recognised during the year and its compliance with IFRS;\n- We assessed the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosure in relation to the requirements of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4743, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc4c021f-9022-4ad7-9bcb-cefa3835ceef": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc4c021f-9022-4ad7-9bcb-cefa3835ceef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef3358ae-eccb-4086-a676-3773510f2cad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b6e293aa1e390fcce9181aeb6703475f965845d040d558aa6cf2bfd749c9fd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Assessment of net realisable value and recoverable amount (\u201cthe value\u201d) of development properties and investment properties (\u201cthe properties\u201d) respectively\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nRefer to notes 2.2, 2.4, 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we have obtained prior to the date of this auditors\u2019 report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 32 of 2021 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors\u2019 report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n# Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Integrated Annual Report (including Directors\u2019 Report), but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors\u2019 report thereon.

not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf

The Group has assessed that based on the sale and purchase agreements entered into with customers and the provisions of relevant laws and regulations, where contracts are entered into to provide real estate assets to customer, the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and usually has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In these circumstances the Group recognises revenue over time. For some geographies where this is not the case, revenue is recognised at a point in time.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nThe Group recognises income from turnover rent on the basis of audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n# Classification of investment properties\n\nThe Group determines whether a property qualifies as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property. In making its judgment, the Group considers whether the property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by the Group. The Group has determined that hotels owned by the Group are to be classified as part of property, plant and equipment rather than investment properties since the Group also operates these assets.\n\n# Operating lease \u2013 Group as lessor\n\nThe Group has entered into commercial and retail property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and so accounts for the contracts as operating leases.\n\n# Classification of investments\n\nManagement designates at the time of acquisition of securities whether these should be classified as at fair value or amortised cost. In judging whether investments in securities are classified as at fair value or amortised cost, management has considered the detailed criteria for determination of such classification as set out in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n149", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2881, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fa801fc-46b0-4a93-b8cf-72a37dd07a54": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fa801fc-46b0-4a93-b8cf-72a37dd07a54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1da2a340-6b20-4c2d-9015-820bb80546b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7e375ee5e26c8a891ae7fa787b865463d843beadb575a4852a1ba6ccb0f572e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nSignificant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options contractual arrangements in place and its ability and the extent of its involvement with the relevant activities of the investee entities to determine whether it controls the investee.\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional years. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nValuation of investment properties\n\nThe Group\u2019s management determines the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering the expected usage of the asset or physical wear and tear. The management periodically reviews estimated useful lives and the depreciation / amortisation method to ensure that the method and period of depreciation / amortisation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\n# Impairment of trade, unbilled receivables and other receivables\n\nAn estimate of the collectible amount of trade, unbilled and other receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. For individually significant amounts, this estimation is performed on an individual basis. Amounts which are not individually significant, but which are past due, are assessed collectively and a provision applied based on expected credit losses on such receivables.\n\n# Hyperinflation\n\nTurkey became a hyperinflationary economy. Management have carried out a detailed assessment of the impact of applying IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and noted that there is no impact of applying IAS 29 on its operations in Turkey, as the functional and presentation currency of the subsidiaries in Turkey is US Dollars. Furthermore, management also monitors other qualitative and quantitative characteristics in its assessment of other potential hyperinflationary economies.\n\n# Recognition of forfeiture income from sales cancellations\n\nUpon termination or cancellation of contracts with customers, amounts received from customers become refundable subject to forfeiture clauses contained in the original sale contract documents and as per local real estate regulations. Forfeited amounts are carried as liability in the consolidated statement of financial position upon cancellation/termination of the contract. Amounts forfeited on cancelled/terminated property units (net of customer refunds, where applicable) are subsequently recognised in the consolidated income statement based on management\u2019s judgment on whether the Group expects any future/continuing association with the erstwhile customer whose amounts are being forfeited.\n\n# Held For sale assessment\n\nDiscussions are underway with certain buyers with regards to potential sale of stake in Emaar India Limited, however the conditions of classification as per IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are not met as at the reporting date.\n\n# Measurement of progress when revenue is recognised over time\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the input method to measure the progress of performance obligations where revenue is recognised over time. The Group considers that the use of the input method which requires revenue recognition on the basis of the Group\u2019s efforts to the satisfaction of the performance obligation provides the best reference of revenue actually earned. In applying the input method, the Group estimates the cost to complete the projects in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4616, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfd8b71b-70ff-45e8-9ff2-5a0799c18a94": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfd8b71b-70ff-45e8-9ff2-5a0799c18a94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90040d48-d75e-4126-9dcd-27c252fac6c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6aaf57804571e17e85b72e991a35e55cfec86184229c66345076e41a264c5bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# For the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nCost to complete the projects and Project cost accruals Considering continued higher inflationary environment and currency devaluation in one of the Company\u2019s international operations, during the previous year management had reassessed value in use of investment property and property, plant and equipment thereon and recorded a net impairment charge of AED 1,109 million in investment property and AED 146 million on property, plant & equipment. The estimate of value in use for the recoverable amount was determined using a pre-tax discount rate of 16%, a terminal yield of 7% and growth rate (rent increase rate) of 6%.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nDuring the current period, management has reassessed the adequacy of project accruals of certain projects and accordingly has written back AED 178 million (31 December 2023: AED 2,265 million) for projects which are fully completed and wherein final settlement is either obtained or management estimates no further contractor claims. Also refer note 5 and note 13.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDevelopment properties are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. The cost of work-in-progress comprises construction costs and other related direct costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less cost of completion and selling expenses. During the previous year, a write down of AED 756 million were recorded for certain land parcels in few international locations where estimated net realisable value was lower than their carrying value. Also refer note 5 and note 13.\n\n# Taxes\n\nThe Group is subject to income and capital gains taxes in all jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total provision for current and deferred taxes. The Group established provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provision is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretations may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n# Fair value measurement\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\nThe external valuer report on the valuation of the Group\u2019s development properties has drawn attention to the fact that a combination of global inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and recent geopolitical events have heightened the potential for greater volatility in property markets over the short-to-medium term, requiring management to closely monitor the valuation and track how market participants respond to current market volatility. Considering the current heightened geopolitical tensions, low economic growth in many major countries, and a \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rate sentiment have increased the potential for constrained credit markets, negative capital value movements and continued volatility in some property markets over the short-to-medium term, management has critically assessed asset valuations and, in the current environment, are satisfied with the assumptions adopted and valuations reported. Management will continue to closely monitor the impact of this evolving situation to assess its impact to the Group, if any.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4607, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c71fdf8b-bcc0-440b-9502-08d3aaac6e2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c71fdf8b-bcc0-440b-9502-08d3aaac6e2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "107e8075-f45f-4ddb-bd51-b125127c1c88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0e673e79896bba7858cd85aefccb4b99fedf72c0dc77e8d144807bb0849da9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n# ABOUT US\n\n# 2.3 Changes in the Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\n# 2.4 Summary of Material Accounting Policies\n\nA number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2024 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

Where the amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised this gives rise to a contract liability.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# Customer loyalty programme\n\nThe Group operates a loyalty points programme, \u2018U by Emaar\u2019, which allows customers to accumulate points when they spend in any of the Group\u2019s hotel or leisure units. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as they provide a material right to the customer. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative stand-alone selling price and recognised as a contract liability until the points are redeemed. Revenue is recognised upon redemption of products by the customer. When estimating the stand-alone selling price of the loyalty points, the Group considers the likelihood that the customer will redeem the points. The Group anticipates its estimates of the points that will be redeemed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the contract liability balance are charged against revenue.\n\n# Lease to buy scheme\n\nSales under the lease to buy scheme are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Rental income during the period of lease is accounted for on a straight-line basis until such time the lessee exercises its option to purchase;\n- When the lessee exercises its option to purchase, a sale is recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policy for sale of property as stated above; and\n- When recognising the sale, revenue is the amount payable by the lessee at the time of exercising the option to acquire the property.\n\n# Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nIncome from turnover rent is recognised based on the audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n# Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n# Revenue from sale of land\n\nThe performance obligation with regards to sale of land is satisfied at a point in time when customer has access to the plot. Upon recognition of revenue against a certain plot, the infrastructure cost allocated to the plot of land is released to the statement of comprehensive income, as cost of revenue.\n\n# Development services\n\nRevenue from rendering of development management services is recognised when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the development obligation at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered. Revenue is recognised overtime.\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4132, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30b03c53-a45d-48c3-99c7-c396779800ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "30b03c53-a45d-48c3-99c7-c396779800ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc4abf9b-0973-4878-be37-c24dca2862bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9e7d99f68e1865b5bfd812053366aecd24e96246b25df2d80845f6ff169a7b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024 items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the consolidated income statement.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\n# UAE Federal Decree-Law No (47) of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses:\n\nOn 9 December 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance released the Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses (\u2018the CT Law\u2019) to enact a Federal corporate tax (\u2018CT\u2019) regime in the UAE. The CT Law is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 June 2023. Decision No. 116 of 2022 specifies the threshold of income (as AED 375,000) over which a corporate tax of 9% would apply. For the Group, current taxes is accounted for as appropriate in the financial statements for the period beginning 1 January 2024. In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, the related deferred tax accounting impact for the UAE component has been considered for the consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\n# Global Minimum Top-up Tax\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has issued the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which mandate a minimum tax rate of 15% per jurisdiction (Pillar Two). Various countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting tax legislation to fully or partially comply with Pillar Two. The United Arab Emirates, where the Group\u2019s Ultimate Parent Entity is situated, has substantively enacted the Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 2024 on the Imposition of Top-up Tax on Multinational Enterprises. The Group falls within the scope of these rules from 1 January 2025 and is currently assessing its exposure to these rules.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether the Pillar Two model rules create additional temporary differences, whether deferred taxes should be remeasured for the Pillar Two model rules, and which tax rate should be used to measure deferred taxes.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Leasehold improvement|2 \u2013 15 years|\n|---|---|\n|Sales centres (included in land and buildings)|1 \u2013 10 years|\n|Buildings|10 \u2013 45 years|\n|Computers and office equipment|2 \u2013 5 years|\n|Plant, machinery and heavy equipment|3 \u2013 20 years|\n|Motor vehicle|3 \u2013 5 years|\n|Furniture and fixture|2 \u2013 10 years|\n|Leisure, entertainment and other asset|2 \u2013 25 years|\n\nNo depreciation is charged on land and capital work-in-progress. The useful lives, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed periodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\nExpenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately is capitalised and the carrying amount of the component that is replaced is written off. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases future economic benefits of the related item of property, plant and equipment. All other expenditure is recognised in the consolidated income statement as the expense is incurred.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell of property, plant and equipment and the value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of property, plant and equipment in an arm\u2019s length transaction while value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of property, plant and equipment and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.\n\n# Investment properties\n\nProperties held for rental or capital appreciation purposes are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Buildings|10 \u2013 45 years|\n|---|---|\n|Furniture, fixtures and others|4 \u2013 10 years|\n|Plant and equipment|3 \u2013 10 years|\n\nNo depreciation is charged on land and capital work-in-progress.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3403, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b38bd73c-a407-4b5d-a1e1-be611d9cf54d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b38bd73c-a407-4b5d-a1e1-be611d9cf54d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "908819d9-c84e-49b8-a561-bf9ae62d0eb6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34affed95a1a27b6a632d93aab04e2030aee4af4b7a2f4a3c359e55a28439f35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nThe useful lives, depreciation method and residual value method are reviewed periodically; the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\nExpenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of investment properties that is accounted for separately is capitalised and the carrying amount of the component that is replaced is written off.

The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the estimated useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\n\nAmortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Customers relationship|5 years|\n|---|---|\n|Software|3 years|\n|Goodwill and Brand|not amortised|\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the asset is derecognised.\n\n# Development properties\n\nProperties acquired, constructed or in the course of construction for sale in the ordinary course of business are classified as development properties and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes:\n\n- Freehold and leasehold rights for land;\n- Amounts paid to contractors for construction;\n- Borrowing costs, planning and design costs, costs of site preparation, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes, construction overheads and other related costs.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, based on market prices at the reporting date and discounted for the time value of money if material, less costs to completion and the estimated costs of sale.\n\nThe cost of development properties recognised in the consolidated income statement on sale is determined with reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non-specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4669, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec7bb457-843d-4ec3-9ee5-df7c9b69e8a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec7bb457-843d-4ec3-9ee5-df7c9b69e8a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe72e567-ce21-403c-afd8-a445fc91a4eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8989cb38a7ff94025675f857a1a5d298ff50bb8b3c55f0c10029a321f42020ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nCommon infrastructure cost is allocated to various projects and forms part of the estimated cost to complete a project in order to determine the cost attributable to revenue being recognised. The development span of some of the development properties is estimated to be over 10 years.\n\nUpon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any differences between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When the remaining investment in joint venture constitutes significant influence, it is accounted for as an investment in associate.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Inventories\n\nInventories represent consumables and other goods relating to hospitality and retail business segments of the Group. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.\n\nCosts are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on disposal or completion.\n\n# Financial assets\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date when the purchase or sale of a financial asset is made under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are initially measured at cost, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. Trade and unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices for assets and offer prices for liabilities, at the close of business on the reporting date. If quoted market prices are not available, reference can also be made to broker or dealer price quotations.\n\nThe fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with credit institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments at the reporting date.\n\n# Classification of financial assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\u2019s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group\u2019s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are \u2018solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\u2019 on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3827, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c006002d-a06d-448d-bacf-a47f8350ca17": {"__data__": {"id_": "c006002d-a06d-448d-bacf-a47f8350ca17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9b2fd06-a92d-4fbc-8168-84b59e090544", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c83e415f6f3e5ffdf69d864ade3d4dc242e609d26c1a1809465fd2fd0ba84b09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nFor the purposes of classifying financial assets, an instrument is an \u2018equity instrument\u2019 if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of \u2018equity\u2019 for the issuer (under IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation) except for certain non-derivative puttable instruments presented as equity by the issuer.

When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against provision for doubtful debts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated income statement.\n\nServices rendered but not billed at the reporting date are accrued as per the terms of the agreements as unbilled receivables.\n\n# Foreign exchange gains and losses\n\nThe fair value of financial assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. The foreign exchange component forms part of its fair value gain or loss. For financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, the foreign exchange component is recognised in the consolidated income statement. For financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income any foreign exchange component is recognised in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income. For foreign currency denominated debt instruments classified at amortised cost, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on the amortised cost of the asset and are recognised in the \u2018other gains and losses\u2019 line item in the consolidated income statement.\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments are also measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) unless they are classified at amortised cost.

When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit impaired. A financial asset is \u2018credit-impaired\u2019 when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\n# Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d) for all debt instruments and contract assets not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset\u2019s original effective interest rate.\n\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information.\n\n# Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount.\n\nAn asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded entities or other available fair value indicators.\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n159", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4297, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f51139f-b9d8-4456-ad38-adfd8c398e33": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f51139f-b9d8-4456-ad38-adfd8c398e33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f10cb7a-a5ba-46a9-b9ed-e793cbb7d294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be90039fa093a3d21f67ce5d92f09de6e98506e7ee9e5b156499b4a3130357e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group\n\nTerm loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.\n\n# Sukuk\n\nThe sukuk are stated at amortised cost using the effective profit rate method. Profit attributable to the sukuk is calculated by applying the prevailing market profit rate, at the time of issue, for similar sukuk instruments and any difference with the profit distributed is added to the carrying amount of the sukuk. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability component.\n\n# Trade and other payables\n\nLiabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not.\n\n# Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.\n\nThe lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\n# Other financial liabilities\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.

The measurement and allocation of cost in an asset acquisition are completed at the date of recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if there are any. Unlike for a business combination, there is no measurement period for an asset acquisition. This is regardless of the size or complexity of the acquisition.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed (except if related to issue of debt or equity).\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the consolidated income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.\n\nWhere goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4005, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dfb5df7-94a9-4958-a73e-672204406c66": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dfb5df7-94a9-4958-a73e-672204406c66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53eb773f-221b-4f82-88f6-098f472d1b80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c9164e91e0f687d7b980ec62d343b9c8b0eb1a53f0b1d0f7be2b6e05039f7c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually as at the reporting date and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as investment in securities and hedges, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n# Foreign currency translations\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in AED which is the functional currency of the Company. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3053, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a114c7e-558e-4961-b4ee-144cad2c9330": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a114c7e-558e-4961-b4ee-144cad2c9330", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c3809662-74cc-4752-9002-8ac599d979b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9bc064980c59dcc3f3524fa930d0bcc3f011860d155df8aadf7bca893f6e2165", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operation including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.\n\nIncome and expenses of foreign operations are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI.\n\nProvisions are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n# 3. Segment Information\n\nManagement monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Business segments\n\nBusiness segment is the primary segment of the Group. For management purposes, the Group is organised into three major segments, namely, real estate (develop, sell and manage condominiums, villas, commercial units and plots of land), leasing, retail and related activities (develop, lease and manage malls, retail, commercial and residential spaces) and hospitality (develop, own and/or manage hotels, serviced apartments and leisure activities).\n\nOther segments include businesses that individually do not meet the criteria for a reportable segment as per IFRS 8 \u2018Operating Segments\u2019. These businesses are property management and utility services and investments in providers of financial services.\n\nRevenue from sources other than property sales, leasing, retail and related activities and hospitality are included in other operating income.\n\n# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n163", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3101, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bed6259-3e7e-4660-acf4-8b7d777f0db6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bed6259-3e7e-4660-acf4-8b7d777f0db6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8885ea2a-e818-4639-a8cf-5024ca940e2f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ee25006ed8a3c41ed9020049d39e800e1d0f93455c82ce01b2c253eb48f5bd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nThe following tables include revenue, profit and certain assets and liabilities information regarding business segments as at and for the years ended 31 December 2024 and 2023.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n|Leasing,|retail and|related| | | | | | | |Hospitality|Others|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | | | | | | | |AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|\n| | | | | | | |2023:| | | | | |\n|Revenue from external customer|- Over a period of time| | | | | | |14,679,906|5,674,482|734,678|-|21,089,066|\n|- Point in time| | | | | | | |3,153,440|1,450,445|1,056,870|-|5,660,755|\n| |Revenue from external customer| | | | | | |17,833,346|7,124,927|1,791,548|-|26,749,821|\n| |2024:| | | | | | | | | | | |\n|- Over a period of time| |23,551,313|5,710,542|827,817|-|30,089,672| | | | | | |\n|- Point in time| |2,979,257|1,248,798|1,187,193|-|5,415,248| | | | | | |\n|Results| |26,530,570|6,959,340|2,015,010|-|35,504,920| | | | | | |\n|Profit before tax before impairment, (a) and (b)| | | | | | | |10,023,797|5,782,358|755,601|517,088|17,078,844|\n| | | | | | | |Impairment, net|-|(1,109,246)|(146,253)|-|(1,255,499)|\n|(a) Unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses| | | | | |-|(836,188)|(b) Unallocated finance income, net|74,407|-| | |\n| |Profit before tax for the year|-|15,061,564|Other segment information| |18,899,780|Capital expenditure| | | | | |\n|(Property, plant and equipment and investment properties)| | | | | | | |150,446|647,807|312,234|64,887|1,175,374|\n|Depreciation|(Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment properties)| | | | | | |235,872|936,554|269,428|85,236|1,527,090|\n| | | | | | | |Finance costs|837,160|150,804|50,428|1,074|1,039,466|\n| | | | | | | |Finance income|1,559,775|28,492|11,212|4,091|1,603,570|\n|Assets and liabilities:|Investments in associates and joint ventures| | | | | | |3,167,399|160,412|579,814|1,721,941|5,629,566|\n| | | | | | | |Other segment assets|98,210,360|27,294,018|6,471,576|1,791,712|133,767,666|\n| | | | | | | |Total segment assets|101,377,759|27,454,430|7,051,390|3,513,653|139,397,232|\n| | | | | | | |Total segment liabilities|43,618,981|6,032,380|2,274,000|640,853|52,566,214|\n| |Total segment liabilities|56,298,184|6,277,615|946,615|629,920|64,152,334| | | | | | |", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2489, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2f98a69-ef69-4e35-88d2-382fdb74fa09": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2f98a69-ef69-4e35-88d2-382fdb74fa09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0feb87df-88b8-4730-a1ad-70e0a81d2d00", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "689381695eb38e12a535b5226ed1cd126c54c55cc7ed06e7ca58bcd1a95307cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n# ABOUT US\n\nThe Group is currently operating in number of countries outside the UAE and is engaged in development of several projects which have significant impact on the Group results.

Deferred tax liabilities were recognised in prior years on account of fair value gain on India assets which were decreased on account of the impairment on non-financial assets. The additional deferred tax liabilities recognised during the year mainly relates to the purchase price allocation impact due to the acquisition of a subsidiary in Egypt and temporary differences arising in Egypt from unrealised income. Furthermore, the recent implementation of the UAE corporate tax law also led to recognition of deferred tax liability on previously recognised goodwill.\n\nThe Group has recognised income tax expense based on the estimate made by the management. The Group\u2019s operations in the UAE are subject to income tax with effect from 1 January 2024. The Group ETR is lower primarily due to the relief available by application of Ministerial Decision 120 of 2023 (\u2018MD 120\u2019) under Transitional rules for Federal Decree Law No. 47 of 2022 on taxation of Corporation and Businesses on immovable properties in the UAE.\n\nTo ensure compliance and obtain further clarity on the appropriate method for calculating the impact of MD 120, a formal clarification request has been submitted to the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) of the UAE. Pending formal clarification, management has recognised the tax relief based on the most likely and probable amount, aligning with the principles of IFRIC 23 \u2018Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments\u2019.

The Group\u2019s risk management policies (both formal and informal) are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.

Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n# PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment at each reporting date that represents its estimate of expected credit losses in respect of trade, unbilled and other receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group has calibrated the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial liabilities comprise interest-bearing loans and borrowings, sukuk, retentions payable and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group\u2019s operations. The Group has various financial assets such as bank balances and cash, trade and unbilled receivables, investment in securities, loan to joint ventures and associates and other receivables and deposits, which arise directly from its operations.\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n# a) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk principally from its receivables from customers, other receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. Total financial assets at amortised cost amounted to AED 70,026,631 thousand (2023: AED 54,980,702 thousand) as at the reporting date.\n\n# Trade, unbilled and other receivables\n\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group\u2019s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate has less influence on credit risk. The Group earns its revenues from a large number of customers spread across different geographies. However, 97% (2023: 98%) of the Group\u2019s trade and unbilled receivables are from the Group\u2019s operations that are based in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts for the sale of residential and commercial units and plots of land on an instalment basis. The instalments are specified in the contracts. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of instalments due. However, the legal ownership of residential, commercial units and plots of land is transferred to the buyer only after all the instalments are recovered. In addition, instalment dues are monitored on an ongoing basis as evidenced by the Group\u2019s low level of bad debts.\n\n# Excessive risk of concentration\n\nConcentration arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.\n\nIn order to avoid excessive concentration of risk, the Group\u2019s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n190", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4029, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25c9cfef-d217-45d0-907a-4456e1fcdb51": {"__data__": {"id_": "25c9cfef-d217-45d0-907a-4456e1fcdb51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3eb69b05-8bb4-4ff3-b61e-0b96a54a1560", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f6602d42a02c78551c66ec54a1234cc29efafb108c56dd82a520caf65801e87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n                                                                   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nINTRODUCTION                                                       For the year ended 31 December 2024\n                                                                              The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of\nABOUT US                                                                      each class of financial assets.

monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair values of equities increase or decrease as a result of changes in the levels of equity indices and the value of individual stocks. The non-trading equity price risk exposure arises from the Group\u2019s investment portfolio. Equity price risk arises from equity instruments held by the Group at fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit and loss. Management of the Group monitors equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market indices. Material investments within the portfolio are managed by qualified fund managers as well as on an individual basis.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe primary goal of the Group\u2019s investment strategy is to maximise investment returns.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n|The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments and include contractual interest payments:| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Financial liabilities| | |Within 1 year|1 to 5 years|Over 5 years|Total|\n|As at 31 December 2024| | |AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|\n|Interest-bearing loans and borrowings| | |2,080,202|1,461,022|-|3,541,224|\n| | |Retentions payable|1,070,839|763,864|-|1,834,703|\n| | |Lease liabilities|132,875|482,837|145,388|761,100|\n|Payable to non-controlling interests| | |-|2,580,376|-|2,580,376|\n| | |Sukuk|239,250|5,448,115|1,972,401|7,659,766|\n| | |Other liabilities|8,450,083|5,246,167|499,811|14,196,061|\n|Total undiscounted financial liabilities| | |11,973,249|15,982,381|2,617,600|30,573,230|\n\n# Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. This tool considers the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. trade and unbilled receivables, other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations.\n\nThe cash flows, funding requirements and liquidity of Group companies are monitored at a centralised level, to optimise the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the Group\u2019s capital resources. The Group\u2019s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank borrowings and finance lease contracts. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities.\n\n| | |Within| |Over| |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | |1 year|1 to 5 years|5 years|Total|\n| |Financial liabilities|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|\n| |As at 31 December 2023| | | | |\n|Interest-bearing loans and borrowings| |1,566,406|2,010,731|-|3,577,137|\n| |Retentions payable|920,566|611,035|-|1,531,601|\n| |Lease liabilities|155,011|516,907|191,742|863,660|\n|Payable to non-controlling interests| |-|247,505|-|247,505|", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3302, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40e032f6-95df-42ce-bc84-c4facbd283eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "40e032f6-95df-42ce-bc84-c4facbd283eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ca3db8b-f3f4-4545-b3c9-ad402f6d2243", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81934decb0474d7fd1b777a005d58dd291ac3402317648e1e8e00db4de5ddffd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# EMA AR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nFinancial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\n| |Financial liabilities|Total|Total|Total|\n|---|---|---|\n| |Within 1 year|1 to 5 years|5 years| |\n|Sukuk|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000|\n| |3,056,863|3,511,480|3,948,016|10,516,359|\n|Other liabilities|8,011,201|5,409,674|361,506|13,782,381|\n|Total undiscounted financial liabilities|13,710,047|12,307,332|4,501,264|30,518,643|\n\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying value unless stated otherwise.\n\n# ANNEXURES\n\n# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nCapital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The Group\u2019s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The primary objective of the Group\u2019s capital management strategy is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group\u2019s policy is to keep the gearing ratio below 50%. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings and sukuk less cash and cash equivalents. Capital includes total equity attributable to the owners of the Company less the net unrealised gains/ (losses) reserve. At 31 December 2024, the Groups\u2019 gearing ratio is negative 89% (2023: negative 38%). The Board of Directors seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.\n\nThe Board of Directors also monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as net operating income attributable to owners of the Company divided by total shareholders\u2019 equity, excluding minority interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to shareholders, the return on capital to shareholders or issuance of new shares to maintain or adjust the capital structure.\n\nNo changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than the statutory requirements in the jurisdictions where the Group entities are incorporated.\n\n# CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinancial information of subsidiaries of the Group that have material non-controlling interest (NCI) are provided below:\n\n|Principal place of business|NCI holding 2024|NCI holding 2023|\n|---|---|---|\n|Emaar Development PJSC|UAE|19.84%|\n|Emaar Misr for Development SAE|Egypt|26.21%|\n|Emaar India Limited|India|22.99%|\n\nThe following table summarises the statement of financial position of these subsidiaries as at 31 December 2024.

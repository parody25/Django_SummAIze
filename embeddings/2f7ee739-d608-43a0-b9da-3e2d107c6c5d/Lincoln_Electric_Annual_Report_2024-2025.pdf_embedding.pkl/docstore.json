Hedlund Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer # DEAR LINCOLN ELECTRIC SHAREHOLDERS, I am pleased to report another year of strong financial and operational performance while navigating a challenging demand environment. By maintaining operational agility, diligently managing costs, launching savings actions, and investing in long-term growth, we delivered record profit margins, strong earnings, cash flow generation, and top quartile returns. As we mark our 130th anniversary, we are better positioned to win than ever before. # FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS We achieved $4 billion in net sales in 2024 from acquisitions and price actions, which were offset by broad volume compression as our larger industrial customers lowered production levels and deferred capital spending. Despite persistent industrial sector headwinds, we successfully offset the unfavorable volume impact with strong execution of our strategic commercial and operational initiatives and launched new savings actions which will deliver over $60 million in annualized savings starting in 2024 and in 2025. These actions resulted in a record adjusted operating income margin of 17.6%, our second highest adjusted earnings per share performance at $9.29 and cash flow generation of $599 million, and maintained top quartile return on invested capital of 21.8%. # 2024 Financial Highlights", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "085782eb-3c27-4258-a26a-1e63b33f1c7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "085782eb-3c27-4258-a26a-1e63b33f1c7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3408d7eb-8dd8-429d-ab87-84c614123613", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd4765f3f42cb9e99a5174c841aa0964e0b89ec77cc7a23f22d2f0b071b3b02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87f857fa-ae69-463b-9722-d9a85643a1cc", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: FINANCIAL METRIC\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: 2020-2025 STRATEGY TARGET\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: 2020-2024 ACHIEVEMENT\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "94b7cf81f0c1afaced6f1458de83bc23d832ab8b6482250644084876ce78be26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# LINCOLN ELECTRIC 2024 ANNUAL REPORT", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 38, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "771f7f54-66e8-4449-a184-8865a34c3461": {"__data__": {"id_": "771f7f54-66e8-4449-a184-8865a34c3461", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3408d7eb-8dd8-429d-ab87-84c614123613", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd4765f3f42cb9e99a5174c841aa0964e0b89ec77cc7a23f22d2f0b071b3b02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "912f7505-d5e7-471b-be70-f2598e333b0e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' FINANCIAL METRIC                         ': {0: ' Sales CAGR (ex-FX)                       ', 1: ' Average Adjusted Operating Income Margin ', 2: ' Americas Welding EBIT margin             ', 3: ' International Welding EBIT margin        ', 4: ' Harris Products Group EBIT margin        ', 5: ' Adjusted EPS CAGR                        ', 6: ' Average ROIC                             ', 7: ' Average Operating Working Capital Ratio  '}, ' 2020-2025 STRATEGY TARGET               ': {0: ' High single-digit to low double-digit % ', 1: ' 16.0% (+/- 150bps)                      ', 2: ' 17% to 19%                              ', 3: ' 12% to 14%                              ', 4: ' 13% to 15%                              ', 5: ' High-teens % Low-20%                    ', 6: ' 18% to 20% (top quartile)               ', 7: ' 15% at 12/31/2025 (top decile)          '}, ' 2020-2024 ACHIEVEMENT ': {0: ' 8%                    ', 1: ' 15.7% average         ', 2: ' 18.0% average         ', 3: ' 10.5% average         ', 4: ' 14.7% average         ', 5: ' 22%                   ', 6: ' 22.1% average         ', 7: ' 16.9%                 '}}", "table_summary": "The table compares the company's strategic financial targets for 2020-2025 with its actual achievements from 2020-2024 across various financial metrics, including sales growth, operating income margin, EBIT margins for different segments, EPS growth, ROIC, and working capital ratio.,\nwith the following columns:\n- FINANCIAL METRIC: None\n- 2020-2025 STRATEGY TARGET: None\n- 2020-2024 ACHIEVEMENT: None\n"}, "hash": "b9840180da81619f2c757c9b5d8a5d08c98484c8ac931d8a1182bc0f2b327cfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1 A maximum of 2% price contribution is used in measuring 2020-2024 sales growth performance.

Our focus on cost management, diligent execution of our strategy, and benefits from our operational initiatives successfully mitigated the impact of lower sales. During this portion of the cycle, we continued to focus on employee safety and training, led with our \u201ccustomer-first\u201d approach, and continued to focus on long-term growth investments. This included record capital spending and R\\&D investments to accelerate innovation. This resulted in our largest launch of new products in the last five years. We believe these initiatives are advancing us towards achieving our 2025 Strategy goals and delivering superior long-term shareholder value. A key element of our growth strategy is acquisitions, and in 2024 we acquired three businesses that complement our core welding businesses, as well as our automation portfolio. These are long-term investments that we believe will further differentiate our portfolio, expand access to key markets, and extend our technical capabilities in the years ahead. These acquisitions bolstered our automation sales in 2024, which compressed slightly to $911 million, but we remain on track to achieve our 2025 $1 billion revenue target at the Company\u2019s average profit margin. Our internal growth initiatives yielded the launch of over 80 new product families in 2024, which was a recent record. We also achieved a 50% vitality index among our standard equipment products, which reflects the momentum of our new product pipeline and the return on our R\\&D investments. Our customer-first approach and collaborative development approach supports the design of new technology and solutions that aim to deliver improved productivity, safety, quality and sustainable features sought by customers. Examples of new products launched in 2024 include our new Flex Lase\u00ae Handheld Laser Welder, which marks our first handheld laser solution, as well as the launch of our portable Elevate\u2122 SLi Battery-Powered Stick Welder which offers a \u2018grab and go\u2019 and \u2018charge anywhere\u2019 versatility needed for remote welding jobs. In addition, we celebrated our 1,000th Cobot sale in 2024, which positions Lincoln Electric as the global leader in this space and reinforces the value proposition of our proprietary Cooper\u2122 Cobot automation solution. We also continued to nurture our early-stage growth initiatives: large scale metal 3D printing and our Velion\u2122 DC fast charger portfolio, which continue to yield positive feedback from customers and industry. In our own operations, we successfully advanced towards our 2025 Strategy sustainability targets. We achieved record safety, recycling, and water conservation performance in 2024, and continued to outperform our 2025 GHG emission reduction target, while lowering the energy intensity of our operations. Our progress reflects our commitment to operational excellence across our global manufacturing and automation assembly facilities, as well as the health and wellness of employees and our communities. Our success demonstrates the effectiveness of our 2025 Strategy and a strong and aligned culture, which has resulted in an improved long-term competitive position and superior shareholder returns through the cycle.\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025 PROXY STATEMENT 7", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3517, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b260c59-026f-41c5-9624-39cd21f55bbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b260c59-026f-41c5-9624-39cd21f55bbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bdc68a9-add7-4c36-9e6d-396ea6a29db9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27f9979525686bebf047d45280a4f57e4d95f6cf062266822c07eac215227ac2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "081f9054-ac21-42b4-a4dc-95211b72ac57", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: NET SALES\nType: string\nSummary: Shows reported net sales and percentage change compared to 2023.\n\nColumn: OPERATING INCOME MARGIN\nType: string\nSummary: Displays reported and adjusted operating income margin with basis points change compared to 2023.\n\nColumn: DILUTED EPS\nType: string\nSummary: Presents reported and adjusted diluted EPS with percentage change compared to 2023."}, "hash": "10d52b4c8292b2c6743789d8d57d1514dc8a0046777c9fd69d31159eba3ab1d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# PROXY SUMMARY # EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION # 2024 Financial Highlights We achieved record profit performance, as well as solid earnings per share, cash flow generation, and adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2024 while navigating a challenging portion of the cycle.

We have a long history of driving an incentive management culture, emphasizing pay for performance to align compensation with the achievement of enterprise, segment and individual goals. We believe our compensation program and practices provide an appropriate balance between profitability, cash flow and returns, on the one hand, and suitable levels of risk-taking, on the other. This balance, in turn, aligns compensation strategies with shareholder interests, as reflected by the consistently high level of shareholders voting for the compensation of our NEOs.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\u2019s process for identifying and evaluating nominees for Director includes annually discussing prospective Director specifications, which serve as the baseline to evaluate candidates. When recruiting new Director candidates, we may involve a recognized search firm, and the CEO and/or a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (usually, the Chair) will contact the prospective director to gauge his or her interest and availability. The candidate will then meet with several members of the Board, including our Lead Independent Director. At the same time, references for the candidate will be contacted. A background check is generally completed before a final recommendation is made to the Board to elect a candidate to the Board. During 2024, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee commenced a search for a new director candidate in light of Hellene Runtagh\u2019s retirement from the Board last April. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retained the search firm of Heidrick & Struggles to help identify director prospects, perform candidate outreach, assist in reference and background checks and provide other related services. During the search process, the Board targeted candidates who were current or former senior executives of public companies with diverse leadership experience in managing global businesses, with strong profit and loss and corporate governance experience. These skills would be beneficial and complementary to the Board, particularly in the current development of the next long-term strategy for the Company. Heidrick & Struggles identified Ms. Falotico as a potential director candidate and, based on the review and recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board determined that Ms. Falotico possessed the desired capabilities and management experience and was elected to the Board on February 19, 2025. Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as Director of Lincoln Electric. The process for nominating Director candidates is set forth in the FAQs section of this Proxy Statement. Director candidates recommended by our shareholders will be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in the same manner as other director candidates and in accordance with the criteria outlined above. # Board Composition The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that having an inclusive Board enhances overall corporate governance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a variety of characteristics, as well as professional background and capabilities, knowledge of specific industries, and geographic experience. To complement the Board\u2019s current composition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee instructs any search firm engaged for each director candidate search to include individuals that represent a variety of characteristics, such as professional background and capabilities, knowledge of specific industries and geographic experiences. 20 LINCOLN ELECTRIC |2025 PROXY STATEMENT", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3314, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf9e08a5-935f-4be9-bb83-d575537cf944": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf9e08a5-935f-4be9-bb83-d575537cf944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b56ff652-8041-4373-b1fc-94b5a4c1c9d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b164910f8013450ed4ddf678682a8b9933caa666892c37d48da8668db0feb47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f81f231-7a18-4fa7-aa68-8a898382d972", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Senior Leadership\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Manufacturing and Industry\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Strategy and M&A\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Financial and Accounting\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Risk Oversight and Management\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Global Operations and Supply Chain\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Organizational Development and Culture\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Technology and Innovation\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Public Company and Corporate Governance\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Sustainability\nType: text\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "beb3f0678e7133cc1cbbc299ae193724e78bf6dcc2481dd6df191ee5f479ff8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# PROPOSAL ONE # Director Nominees\u2019 Skills, Experience and Background Throughout 2024, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the skills, qualifications and experience of each Director Nominee to ensure that each Director Nominee can effectively oversee our long-term business strategy.

The Director Independence Standards are available on our website at www.lincolnelectric.com. During 2024, the independent Directors met in regularly scheduled Executive Sessions in conjunction with each of the regular Board meetings. The Lead Independent Director presided over these sessions. # BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE\n\n* Chair of the Board: Steven B. Hedlund, appointed January 1, 2025 (prior to Mr. Hedlund\u2019s appointment, Christopher L. Mapes served as Executive Chair of the Board)\n* Lead Independent Director: Curtis E. Espeland\n* All four Board committees are composed of independent Directors\n* Independent Directors met in Executive Session at each of the regular 2024 Board meetings\n\n\\# CHAIR OF THE BOARD The Board periodically evaluates its leadership structure to ensure independent and effective oversight of management and our business. Effective January 1, 2025, Mr. Hedlund, our President and CEO, was appointed Chair of the Board. During 2024, Mr. Mapes served as Executive Chair to assist with the transition of Mr. Hedlund into the CEO role. The Board believes having one individual serve as Chair and CEO is beneficial because the dual role enhances Mr. Hedlund\u2019s ability to provide direction and insight on strategic initiatives impacting us and our shareholders. The Board also believes the dual role is consistent with good corporate governance practices because it is complemented by a Lead Independent Director. As Chair, Mr. Hedlund is responsible for planning, formulating and coordinating the development and execution of our corporate strategy, policies, goals and objectives. He is accountable for Lincoln Electric\u2019s performance and:\n\n* Works closely with our senior management to develop our strategic plan;\n* Works with our management on transactional matters by networking with strategic relationships;\n* Promotes and monitors the Board\u2019s fulfillment of its oversight and governance responsibilities;\n* Encourages the Board to set and implement our goals and strategies;\n* Establishes procedures to govern our Board\u2019s work;\n* Oversees the execution of the financial and other decisions of our Board;\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025 PROXY STATEMENT 31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3619, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "454ca468-bfda-4b66-b483-410bedd3a5e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "454ca468-bfda-4b66-b483-410bedd3a5e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b5c875f-9a5d-4516-a260-e08e4895dea3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "775f4269a87290546675bcc100bb291e56a1f08d302e45a962e093057f8523f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n* Makes available to all members of our Board opportunities to acquire sufficient knowledge and understanding of our business to enable them to make informed judgments;\n* Provides input on the design of the Board, including Board and committee composition, size, membership, leadership, structure and oversight responsibilities, as part of the Board\u2019s and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\u2019s periodic review of such matters;\n* Presides over meetings of our shareholders;\n* Represents the Board as appropriate in communications with shareholders and other stakeholders;\n* Sets the agenda (in conjunction with the Lead Independent Director) and presides over Board meetings.\n\n\\# LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR To complement our Chair, the Board has a strong Lead Independent Director, which we believe appropriately addresses the need for independent leadership and an organizational structure for our independent Directors.

Our Governance Guidelines require annual evaluation of the performance of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the assistance of the Lead Independent Director, oversees the annual evaluation process. As part of this process, each Board member completes an evaluation relative to Committee and Board matters. The Lead Independent Director often holds one-on-one calls with each Board member as well. A summary of the results of this process is presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The results are then reported to the full Board by the Lead Independent Director, which considers the results and ways in which Board processes and effectiveness may be enhanced. # Majority Voting Policy The Director Nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected (plurality standard). However, our majority voting policy states that any Director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested director election in his/her favor is required to submit his/her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then consider each resignation and determine whether to accept or reject it, with full Board approval of such decision. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of a Director and are not counted under our majority voting policy. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of a Director. # Annual Meeting Attendance; No Special Arrangements Directors are expected to attend each annual meeting. The Director Nominees plan to attend this year\u2019s virtual Annual Meeting. All of our then-current Director Nominees attended our 2024 Annual Meeting. None of the Director Nominees has any special arrangement or understanding with any other person pursuant to which the Director Nominee was or is to be selected as a Director or Director Nominee. There are no family relationships, as defined by SEC rules, among any of our Directors or executive officers. SEC rules define the term \u201cfamily relationship\u201d to mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin. # Oversight of Our Company # BOARD OVERSIGHT OF STRATEGY One of the Board\u2019s key responsibilities is overseeing the Company\u2019s strategic planning process, including reviewing the steps taken to develop strategic plans and approving the final plans. In 2024, this included receiving periodic updates regarding the Company\u2019s execution and performance against our 2025 Strategy, as well as the development of our next (2030) long-term strategy. Our Board regularly discusses the key priorities of our Company, taking into consideration global economic, consumer and other significant trends. The Company\u2019s long-term strategic plan is reviewed regularly with the Board, along with its annual operating plan, capital structure and sustainability performance. # BOARD OVERSIGHT OF ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT In the ordinary course of business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. Our enterprise risk management process seeks to identify and address material risks to the organization, and the Board provides oversight as to how management is addressing these risks. The Company maintains an enterprise risk management review process where risk is assessed throughout our entire organization, and is reported to our internal corporate enterprise risk committee, comprised of members of our business units and various functional leaders (e.g., IT, Finance, Legal), led by our Chief Financial Officer, working with our Director of Internal Audit.

The Company maintains insurance coverage with respect to cybersecurity and has undergone several simulation, preparedness and response exercises. The Company has not experienced a reportable information security breach within the last three years and is tested externally on its information security environment at least annually. In addition, the Company has a Chief Digital Information Officer, and an information security training program, which calls for training of all computer-based employees through various employee training modules relative to information security matters and phishing simulation events with employees to raise cybersecurity awareness. # BOARD OVERSIGHT OF SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS Our sustainability programs include a range of initiatives around corporate responsibility, safety and environmental performance, and human capital topics, which reflects our Board\u2019s recognition of the importance of achieving our goals responsibly and aligning with our key stakeholders to drive long-term value creation. Issues that we focus on include workplace health and safety, reduction of the impact of our operational footprint through reduced emissions, lower energy intensity, and conservation of natural resources, human capital management, workplace culture, employee development and engagement, corporate governance, business ethics and compliance, cybersecurity, and strong community partnerships. # THE BOARD HAS BROAD OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS The Board receives a formal annual update on corporate governance matters, including sustainability development considerations.

One key area of engagement is our investment in training and development to prepare our workforce for the future needs of the company and to support our growth strategy. This also contributes to preparing our employees for future career opportunities and ensuring a strong succession pipeline. In addition to formal leadership, management and professional development programs, we provide a bold initiative to repay up to $125,000 towards each of our U.S. employees\u2019 student loan debt obligations. This program has been enthusiastically welcomed by both our existing talent and at recruiting events on university campuses across the country. Tuition reimbursement programs also are in place for external accredited programs and we provide mentoring, self-guided online courses, instructor-led programs, and special project and rotational assignments that can lead to extensive global exposure and talent development. In addition to our career development programs, our annual talent and succession planning process reviews 100% of our global professional staff. This ensures all high potential employees have an active individual development plan to guide their career aspirations. This process also helps to ensure we have an appropriate talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering and operations. These talent reviews include our CEO and all segment and functional leaders who use this process to identify and support high potential talent in succession planning for the next generation of Lincoln Electric\u2019s leaders. # Community Engagement In 2024, we maintained our employee assistance program, supported our internal employee resource group initiatives and community engagement through our Lincoln Electric Foundation grants, our U.S. employee matching program for donations and volunteerism, in-kind gifts, sponsorship of key events, and the hosting of community and academic events at our facilities. In addition, we maintained our community educational/career programming among secondary and high school students to address the skills gap in industry and expand awareness of attractive career pathways in manufacturing. This programming, along with our continued support of regional youth programs, welding competitions and serving as the global welding sponsor of WorldSkills\u00ae are foundational to our efforts to promote the trades and the science of welding. # Compensation-Related Risk We regularly assess risks related to our compensation and benefit programs, including our executive compensation program, and our Compensation and Executive Development Committee is actively involved in those assessments. In addition, our independent executive compensation consultants completed a risk assessment of our executive compensation program in 2024. Although we have a long history of pay for performance and incentive-based compensation, we believe our compensation programs contain many mitigating factors to ensure that our employees are not encouraged to take unnecessary risks. As a result of all these efforts, we do not believe the risks arising from our executive compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Lincoln Electric. 42 LINCOLN ELECTRIC |2025 PROXY STATEMENT", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3539, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84d7798e-4aaa-4787-b592-08d26216e6e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "84d7798e-4aaa-4787-b592-08d26216e6e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa0b133d-af06-4223-b51c-fe0cc8bc0fdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e72442818303b141abf1484f8a4694f981c90dd4cc1517da4352d0ebf289196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE # Related-Party Transactions The Board has adopted a policy regarding the review and approval of transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and certain related parties that are required to be disclosed in proxy statements, which are referred to as \u201crelated-party transactions.\u201d Related parties include our Directors, Director Nominees, executive officers, persons controlling 5% or more of our common shares, and the immediate family members of these individuals. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions and will consider information it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, whether the terms of the transaction are no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances, the approximate dollar value of the transaction, and the nature and extent of the related party\u2019s interest in the transaction. No Director will participate in any discussion or approval of a related-party transaction for which he or she is a related party, other than to provide material information concerning the transaction. We define \u201crelated-party transactions\u201d generally as transactions collectively over $120,000 in any calendar year, in which any related party had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. We have a monitoring and reporting program, which includes requirements to report all actual or potential related-party transactions during the year and information regarding all relationships with entities involving a related party. The Company did not have any related-party transactions that required Audit Committee approval in 2024. # Director Compensation # OUR BOARD COMPENSATION PROGRAM Based upon the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board determines our non-employee Director compensation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews all elements of Board compensation in relation to our proxy peer group (as identified in the CD\\&A), trends in Board compensation and other factors it deems appropriate. In October 2024, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the non-employee Director compensation program, with Meridian Compensation Partners as independent advisor, and determined the cash and equity retainers were aligned with our proxy peer group. The objectives of our non-employee Director compensation program are to help attract highly qualified individuals to serve on our Board and to align their interests with those of our shareholders. As a result, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended no changes to the non-employee Director compensation program to the Board.

We also incorporate continuing education topics for Directors into our Board meetings throughout the year. Artificial intelligence (AI) was one such topic during 2024. # STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES In keeping with the philosophy that Directors\u2019 interests should be aligned with the shareholders\u2019 interest and as part of the Board\u2019s continued focus on corporate governance, all of our non-employee Directors must adhere to our stock ownership guidelines. RSUs, including any RSUs that have been deferred under the Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan, count toward the stock ownership amount; shares held in another person\u2019s name (including a relative) do not. The stock ownership guidelines can be met by satisfying one of the two thresholds noted in the chart below. Directors have five years from the date of election to the Board to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines. As of December 31, 2024, all of our non-employee Directors had satisfied the stock ownership guidelines, except for Ms. Fetch and Mr. Howze who were appointed to the Board in 2023, and Ms. Falotico who was appointed to the Board in February 2025.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1576, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1c32878-861c-4f76-adb2-4e59b65a921e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1c32878-861c-4f76-adb2-4e59b65a921e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f57d714-05ee-477c-8b59-b0d07d44a5e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9df4fd9bd7868dcd03a8080855189719227bc0182077f7b5cbdd2a46e720e878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "37bba02b-bb8e-4168-859b-85815aa0c6af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Retainer Multiple                                                                                                                           ': {0: ' Shares valued at 5x annual Board retainer (total of $475,000)                                                                               ', 1: ' 2,185\\\\*                                                                                                                                     ', 2: ' \\\\* Represents shares equal to $475,000 based on the closing price of Lincoln Electric stock as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day).

The next review is anticipated to occur in 2025. # EQUITY AWARDS The non-employee Directors\u2019 RSUs awards are granted under the 2023 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Under the terms of the awards, RSUs generally vest in full one year after the date of grant. In addition, the awards vest in full in the event of a change in control of Lincoln Electric if the Director\u2019s service is terminated or if the award is not assumed upon the change in control. The awards also vest in full upon the death or disability of the Director, or vest pro rata, based on length of service from the date of grant, upon the retirement of the Director. Dividend equivalents are sequestered until the shares underlying the RSUs are distributed, at which time the dividend equivalents are paid in cash. # DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN The Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan allows the non-employee Directors to defer payment of all or a portion of their annual cash compensation and RSUs granted to them. This plan allows each participating non-employee Director to elect to begin payment of the deferred amounts as of the earlier of termination of service as a Director, death or a date not less than one full calendar year after the year the fees are initially deferred. The investment elections available under the plan for cash compensation deferred are the same as those available to executives under our Top Hat Plan, which is discussed in the executive compensation narrative under 2024 Deferred Compensation Benefits.

KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE We have a strong track record of delivering increased value to our shareholders and we have typically delivered above-market performance across various financial metrics over many economic cycles. Our long-term strategy seeks to achieve profitable sales growth both organically and through acquisitions by emphasizing value-added solutions and differentiated technologies. We anticipate this strategy will yield improved profit margins and returns and will generate best-in-class financial performance measured against our peer group. In 2024, we achieved record profitability, as well as solid earnings per share performance, cash flow generation, and adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) while navigating a challenging portion of the cycle. Slower industrial activity and reduced capital spending across most of our end markets resulted in a 4% decline in net sales to $4.0 billion. Diligent cost management, the rapid deployment of temporary and permanent cost actions, as well as the benefits of our ongoing operational initiatives mitigated the impact of lower demand and generated a record 17.6% adjusted operating income margin. Cash flows from operations remained strong at $599 million on improved margin performance and improved working capital performance, which resulted in a 91% cash conversion ratio. Solid Adjusted ROIC of 21.8% remains top-quartile versus proxy peers and demonstrates the effectiveness of our 2025 Strategy and our disciplined capital allocation approach.\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025

Therefore, we have established a program that ties executive compensation to superior financial performance. To assess pay for performance, we evaluate the relationship between CEO and NEO realizable pay and key financial metrics including TSR. This allows us to understand the relative degree of alignment between the pay delivered and the performance achieved for shareholders. In 2024, this analysis was performed by our external advisors and reviewed with the Compensation and Executive Development Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). # 2024 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACTIONS The Committee annually considers the overall design of our executive compensation program, ensuring alignment with shareholder interests and our pay for performance philosophy, while considering prevailing best practices across our industry and the broader market. Significant consideration is also given to shareholder feedback, including the say-on-pay vote. At our 2024 Annual Meeting, we received 97% approval, based on the total votes cast, for our annual advisory say-on-pay vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs. The Committee believes the voting results demonstrate significant support for our executive compensation program. Based on this outcome, the current long-term strategy in place, and a review of peer and broader market practices, the Committee chose not to make any substantial changes to the existing program previously approved for 2023. With the transition of independent compensation consultants in 2024, the Committee completed a holistic review of our executive compensation program to ensure it meets the objectives noted above. # GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES In addition to our emphasis on above-market financial performance and pay for performance, we design our executive compensation program to be current with best practices and good corporate governance. We also consider the risks associated with any particular program, design or compensation decision. We believe these assessments result in sustained, long-term shareholder value. Some of those governance practices are described in the Compensation-Related Risk section in this Proxy Statement.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2411, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77cec406-bc38-44fb-b9de-a2025f3a53b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "77cec406-bc38-44fb-b9de-a2025f3a53b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9346b3cb-8901-494f-a984-cf61516ea566", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b50cc86e997d66abbc9052d8b4c3c942783792ab3de4d51ee87237b488817c13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a28caf0-53a3-4258-be9f-032ae0e48d2b", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Type\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Component and Competitive Target\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Philosophy and Objective\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "6e1bddde2ff72c11d2e17c6d71c10a65ccb89cc287df40161f8025d73ae2466c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION # OUR COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY # Core Principles Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain exceptional employees, while maintaining our strong pay for performance culture.

The Committee then uses competitive market data, performance assessments, and independent executive compensation consultants and management recommendations to set the pay components along the targets described above (for example, 45th percentile for base pay). Actual pay for executive management will generally fall within a range of these targets (plus or minus 20%). Absent significant increases due to promotion, increases for break-through individual performance or significant changes in the competitive market data, pay increases are considered generally in line with national trends. # MARKET COMPARISON DATA We collect competitive market compensation data from multiple nationally published surveys and from proxy data for a peer group of companies. Nationally published survey market compensation data is statistically determined (through regression analysis) to approximate our revenue size and aged to approximate more current data. The Company did not select the companies that comprise any of these survey groups. The Company generally blends 50% survey and 50% peer data for benchmarking executive compensation for our NEOs. # PEER GROUP We use a peer group of publicly traded industrial companies that are headquartered in the U.S. that serve a number of different market segments and that have significant foreign operations. These are companies with which Lincoln Electric competes for talent and shareholder investment. In addition, we only select companies with solid historical financial results (removing companies from the peer group when their financial performance has consistently fallen below a reasonable level). The Committee conducted an annual review of our peer group, with the assistance of our independent advisor. In July 2023, Willis Towers Watson, the Committee\u2019s prior independent advisor, recommended that no changes were needed for the 2024 compensation planning cycle, but noted that following the split of Crane Company into Crane NXT and Crane Co., the inclusion of Crane Co. as the Company\u2019s peer was appropriate, as the business was aligned and the revenue projection was within the peer group range. # For 2024, our peer group consisted of the following 18 publicly traded industrial corporations:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2515, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38380a85-3660-484b-ae1c-24e9babdbac0": {"__data__": {"id_": "38380a85-3660-484b-ae1c-24e9babdbac0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90713bbd-9bf3-46bf-8e26-38db16ab08a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1a85b6e56a2447b02f13c181dc9b13a02dbb469f0bdfd3232244963129d2418", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71b5f812-3629-4a08-8343-596e58a1e0d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Ametek Inc.

We believe that, given base pay is below market, annual cash bonus opportunities should be above average to balance some of the risk associated with greater variable compensation. However, we also believe that above-market pay should be linked to financial and individual performance. Therefore, we target total cash compensation (base pay and target annual bonus) at the 65th percentile of the market, but use a structure that provides payments of above-average bonuses only where the performance of the consolidated company and the performance of an NEO\u2019s particular segment or business unit warrant it. We also consider the impact of an officer\u2019s individual performance during the year. # ANNUAL BONUS (EMIP) FORMULA With respect to 2024, the formula to determine each NEOs annual bonus (EMIP Bonus Payout) includes a Financial Performance Factor and an Individual Performance Factor. The Financial Performance Factor considers the financial performance of specific financial metrics of the consolidated Company and for operations roles, the segment or business units they support. If the financial performance target is not met on any specific financial metric, the EMIP Bonus Payout will be reduced, with the potential that no bonus will be paid if performance across all metrics is below threshold. If financial performance exceeds expectations on any of the specific financial metrics, the percentage of annual bonus paid can be above the Target Bonus Amount. Once financial performance is calculated, an Individual Performance Factor is considered to determine the final EMIP Bonus Payout. The maximum EMIP Bonus Payout, considering financial and individual performance, will not exceed 200% of an individual\u2019s annual Target Bonus Amount. # 2024 EMIP BONUS CALCULATION", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a9e3f6b-8059-49c4-9ef3-f2fe9222ae67": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a9e3f6b-8059-49c4-9ef3-f2fe9222ae67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13314622-cbd7-4b05-b04f-ba56625b5dab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92522f6732f6def27f85e095bf8bad335b645e0856095b051ed10a72d327415d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fc4eef7-50d0-44cb-bcf5-7869e8c10eb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Target Bonus Amount ': {0: '                     '}, ' Financial Performance Factor ': {0: '                              '}, ' Individual Performance Factor ': {0: '                               '}, ' EMIP Bonus Payout ': {0: '                   '}}", "table_summary": "The table outlines the components involved in calculating the EMIP Bonus Payout, including the target bonus amount, financial performance factor, and individual performance factor.,\nwith the following columns:\n- Target Bonus Amount: None\n- Financial Performance Factor: None\n- Individual Performance Factor: None\n- EMIP Bonus Payout: None\n"}, "hash": "9118a1e2b48072badf1cdd67f184fb92707095101b5804666ae2c5fe5c3d14b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Committee has discretion to approve EMIP payments outside of the strict application of this calculation, although no discretion was used for calculation of the 2024 annual bonuses.

By varying the financial metrics used based upon areas of responsibility, it is possible that certain participants will receive a higher percentage of target bonus while others will receive a lower percentage of target bonus where the segment performance for one participant is better than the segment performance for the other.

We have targeted the median of the market, in keeping with our pay for performance philosophy, because we believe that superior long-term financial growth itself should be the main driver of above-market long-term incentive compensation. For 2024, our long-term incentive compensation program consists of three components: (1) stock options, (2) RSUs and (3) Performance Shares. The value of each is weighted equally. This provides an even balance with respect to the different attributes and timing associated with each type of award. Annual awards of all three components are made to EMIP participants, including the NEOs. # Valuation of Equity Awards We use standard valuation methods to convert long-term incentive compensation values to shares upon the grant date. These methods consider a 7-day historical average of our stock price, up to and including the grant date, for RSUs and Performance Shares and the grant date Black-Scholes valuation for stock options. # Normal Cycle and Out-of-Cycle Equity Awards The Committee has discretion in awarding grants to EMIP participants and does not delegate its authority to management, nor does management select or influence the award dates. Occasionally, the Committee may approve limited, out-of-cycle special awards for specific business purposes or in connection with executive promotions or the hiring of new executive employees. However, the date used for normal cycle awards to all EMIP participants, including the NEOs, is the date of a regularly scheduled Committee meeting, which is fixed well in advance and generally occurs at the same time each year. The Committee has approved delegated authority to the CEO to designate awards through 2025 to certain employees under our equity plan, subject to specific limits established. The CEO can only grant RSU awards and cannot grant awards to any executive officers, Section 16 officers or greater-than-10% beneficial owners of the Company, and such awards must be granted pursuant to the agreements and vesting terms already approved by the Committee.\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025 PROXY STATEMENT 65", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1392, "end_char_idx": 3742, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fcdab66-e13d-4c50-a25f-a88a58a6f406": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fcdab66-e13d-4c50-a25f-a88a58a6f406", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b14425f-7fe8-4d1e-90d3-471affbc290f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fed7a83d73a5f0943d5700d7341b4a6e3a927b2f73b51c2722f15367c333b25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ab8c28d-1dc3-48c5-a277-bb0aeb263c2c", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Standard Vesting Provision\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Accelerated Vesting Provisions\nType: text\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "9e31e2a130c4013bdd0a6b3c1cec805515e5c629d916c7d1e821d04778e2d559", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following is a summary of the three components of our long-term incentive compensation program, in which all our NEOs participate, as in effect for 2024:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7804efcb-7ec0-435b-b207-1e3b8faa84a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7804efcb-7ec0-435b-b207-1e3b8faa84a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b14425f-7fe8-4d1e-90d3-471affbc290f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fed7a83d73a5f0943d5700d7341b4a6e3a927b2f73b51c2722f15367c333b25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9eaa87cc-2c4f-4148-9962-b8d6e986b5dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Standard Vesting Provision                                                              ': {0: ' Stock Options                                                                           ', 1: ' \u2022 Vest ratably over 3 years 1/3 1/3 1/3                                                 ', 2: ' Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)                                                           ', 3: ' \u2022 Vest in full after 3 years                                                            ', 4: ' Performance Shares                                                                      ', 5: ' \u2022 Vest based on performance during the applicable 3-year performance period 1/3 1/3 1/3 '}, ' Accelerated Vesting Provisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ': {0: ' \u2022 Full vesting upon death or disability. \u2022 Full vesting upon retirement. \u2022 Full vesting in the event of a change in control, if (i) replacement awards are not provided or (ii) replacement awards are provided and there is a subsequent qualifying termination.

To the extent an adjustment relates to restructuring or rationalization charges that are intended to improve organizational efficiency, a corresponding charge (equal to the adjustment) is amortized against future years\u2019 adjusted net income until that adjustment is fully offset against the intended savings (generally this amortization occurs over a three-year period). # PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS In setting the performance ranges for a new three-year period (including the 2024 to 2026 performance cycle), the Committee considers various factors, including historical performance against established ranges, to try to achieve a 50% probability of attaining the target for any cycle.

In evaluating 2024 long-term incentive compensation (at the beginning of 2024), the Committee reviewed 2023 compensation versus the competitive benchmarks. The Committee concluded that overall the long-term incentive compensation program for the NEOs remained within the competitive benchmark. Excluding Mr. Mapes and Mr. Hedlund, the Committee adjusted 2024 long-term incentive compensation opportunities for the NEOs on average 4.2%, placing their LTI targets above the 50th percentile, however still within the competitive framework. All of these awards are subject to our Recovery of Funds Policy, which is discussed below. The Performance Shares financial metrics for the 2024 to 2026 performance cycle remained consistent with prior years: 50% is based on the growth in Adjusted Net Income for Compensation Purposes over the 3-year performance period and 50% is based on our 3-year average ROIC for Compensation Purposes relative to our proxy peer group. Additionally, the performance ranges for the 2024 to 2026 performance cycle align with the ranges outlined above in analysis of the actual Performance Share payout for the 2022 to 2024 Performance Share cycle.

The Committee also reviews prevailing best practices across our industry and the broader market. Significant consideration is also given to shareholder feedback including the say-on-pay vote. With the recent CEO transition and the transition to a new independent compensation consultant in 2024, the Committee undertook a holistic review of our executive compensation program to help ensure it meets the objectives noted above.

Some aspects of our benefit programs are considered non-traditional due to their relationship with our pay for performance and incentive-based philosophies. For example, the premiums for Lincoln Electric-provided medical coverage are primarily paid by employees, including the NEOs, on a pre-tax basis. Premiums for dental coverage, which is a voluntary benefit, are 100% paid by employees. Life insurance coverage paid fully by Lincoln Electric is set at $50,000 per employee, including the NEOs, although employees may purchase additional insurance at their own cost. The NEOs participate in this same cost-sharing approach. We attempt to balance our various non-traditional programs (such as those with a significant portion of the cost borne by the employee) with more traditional programs. We also provide accidental death and dismemberment benefits to officers, due to the significant amount of travel required in their jobs. Under this program, the premiums of which are paid by the Company, a participant\u2019s beneficiary would receive a payment of five times annual total cash compensation up to a maximum of $3,000,000 for executive officers and $2,000,000 for other officers upon an officer\u2019s accidental death. The policy also provides dismemberment benefits of up to 100% of the death benefit in the event an officer is permanently and totally disabled as a result of an accident, and it provides for medical evacuation coverage in the event of an accident. # PERQUISITES Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, we offer limited perquisites. We pay for an annual physical for officers and other senior management to preserve our investment in them by encouraging them to maintain healthy lifestyles and be proactive in preventative care. We also make available financial planning services to certain officers, enabling them to concentrate on business matters rather than on personal financial planning. However, the cost of these financial planning services is included in the income of the participants. We also pay the cost of certain club dues for some officers to encourage social interaction with peers from other companies, local leadership in the community and to provide the ability to hold business meetings at a convenient offsite location. All personal expenses are borne entirely by the executive and the club dues are included in the income of the participants. Different perquisites are provided from time to time to non-U.S. based executives; however, they are customary and reasonable in nature and amount relative to local market practices (for example, a car lease). Company-paid travel expenses are primarily for business purposes, but occasionally spouses or other guests may accompany our executive officers on business trips. The aggregate incremental cost of such personal travel is attributed to the applicable NEO. # RETIREMENT PROGRAMS Retirement benefits are provided to our NEOs through the following programs: # The Lincoln Electric Company Employee Savings Plan (401(K) Plan)\n\n* Each eligible employee of The Lincoln Electric Company and certain affiliate companies is eligible to receive up to 6% of annual compensation in Company contributions through:\n* * matching employer contributions equal to 100% of contributions made to the 401(k) Plan, but not in excess of 3% of annual compensation;

For a more detailed discussion of our change in control agreements, see Termination and Change in Control Arrangements below. Outside of these change in control agreements, we do not maintain written employment or other severance agreements for U.S.-based employees. # RECOVERY OF FUNDS POLICIES We maintained a Clawback Policy during 2024 to comply with the requirements of new SEC regulations and Nasdaq listing standards. We also maintained a Supplemental Recovery of Funds Policy during 2024 that works in tandem with and as a supplement to the Clawback Policy. Our Clawback Policy and the Supplemental Recovery of Funds Policy are applicable to all of our executive officers, including our NEOs. The Clawback Policy provides for the reasonably prompt recovery (or clawback) of certain excess incentive-based compensation received during an applicable three-year recovery period by current or former executive officers in the event we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. Triggering events include accounting restatements to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to such previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Excess incentive-based compensation for these purposes generally means the amount of incentive-based compensation received (on or after October 2, 2023) by such executive officer that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that would have been received by such executive officer had it been determined based on the restated amounts, without regard to any taxes paid. Incentive-based compensation potentially subject to recovery under the mandatory accounting restatement provisions of the Clawback Policy is generally limited to any compensation granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of one or more financial reporting measures. In general, we may utilize a broad range of recoupment methods under the Clawback Policy for mandatory accounting restatement clawbacks. The Clawback Policy does not condition such clawback on the fault of the executive officer, but we are not required to clawback amounts in limited circumstances where the Compensation and Executive Development Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable and (1) we have already attempted to recover such amounts but the direct expense paid to a third party in an effort to enforce the Clawback Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, (2) the recovery of amounts would violate applicable home country law, or (3) the recovery would likely cause the non-compliance of a tax-qualified retirement plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable regulations. Operation of the mandatory accounting restatement provisions of the Clawback Policy is subject to a brief phase-in process during the first few years after its effectiveness. We may not indemnify any such executive officer against the loss of such recovered compensation in the event of a mandatory accounting restatement. The Supplemental Recovery of Funds Policy in general provides for compensation recovery on terms substantially similar to the Clawback Policy, but specifically for compensation that is not covered by or subject to the Clawback Policy (for example, that pre-dates the scope or effectiveness of the Clawback Policy). The Supplemental Recovery of Funds Policy is also triggered if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and applies to our current or former executive officers and their incentive-based compensation (as described above) received during an applicable three-year recovery period. 74 LINCOLN ELECTRIC 2025 PROXY STATEMENT", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef6dd1f8-787b-4bf1-ac05-6f9148e96dce": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef6dd1f8-787b-4bf1-ac05-6f9148e96dce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f308ccb3-478d-4088-9a93-328591e4da66", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76c59e31363ef56e0db48f1d08c4403e6eefa72016ce5de525c15b8ef4c12780", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db6e990a-28d3-4321-a738-1e4da76ed9c6", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Executive Group\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Ownership Guideline\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "990eeaf1db6bef7d165e6030477a3b4c7920dd05e9e186f15ee692e997029831", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION # INSIDER TRADING POLICY AND ANTI-HEDGING/PLEDGING POLICY We maintain an insider trading policy applicable to our Directors, executive officers and other employees, and have implemented processes for the Company, that we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, including Nasdaq rules, in connection with the purchase, sale, and or other dispositions of Company securities or the securities of other companies with which we do business.

An officer must satisfy the applicable stock ownership guideline before he or she is permitted to sell shares, including shares issued as a result of RSUs vesting or Performance Shares vesting (other than shares withheld to cover taxes) and shares obtained from the exercise of stock options (other than shares withheld to cover exercise cost and taxes). Unless an officer is promoted into a higher guideline level, the stock ownership guideline will reset every 5 years utilizing updated base pay and stock price information. RSU awards count towards an officer\u2019s stock ownership amount, however common shares underlying stock options, Performance Shares and shares held in another person\u2019s name (including a relative) do not. As of December 31, 2024, all of our NEOs met the applicable stock ownership guidelines. # POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS Under the Company\u2019s policies and practices, while the Committee does not have predetermined fixed dates upon which grants must be made, stock options (including those granted to our NEOs) are generally granted as part of annual award opportunities at a regularly scheduled Committee meeting or via a unanimous written consent executed by the Committee during January or February of each year. Such Committee meetings are generally scheduled at least one year in advance. Grants for any new hire or promoted employee who would otherwise receive a relevant grant of stock options after such February grant date in any year are generally made on an ad hoc basis, from time to time as determined by the Committee, as needed under the particular circumstances of such new hire or promotion, and at a special Committee meeting or via unanimous written consent of the Committee. All such stock options are generally granted under a shareholder-approved plan and with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company\u2019s common shares on the date of grant.\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025 PROXY STATEMENT 75", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2133, "end_char_idx": 4207, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdf7d0fe-2723-4040-9692-dfacd9b9aa30": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdf7d0fe-2723-4040-9692-dfacd9b9aa30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10d499b3-342a-487c-a0d9-8009854d21b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b4571957768fec190ce21ba7522862250f14011843dbe2b18f1325509acfcd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION As a general matter, the Committee does not take material nonpublic information into account when determining the timing and terms of such stock option awards. Due to the grant timing described above, grants may be made both during or outside of open trading windows. This grant timing is used to provide for a routine and regular grant practice regarding all employees\u2019 stock options, and in order to make sure that the existence (or lack thereof) of material nonpublic information is not a factor in decisions about the timing or size of stock option grants. In this sense, the Committee acts in a neutral manner with respect to the existence (or lack thereof) of material nonpublic information when making stock option grants. In 2024, stock option grants were made at times that did not trigger proxy statement disclosure of such grants under certain new disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K Item 401(x)(1), and the Company has not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. During 2024, the Company did not grant stock options to any NEO during any period beginning four business days before and ending one business day after the filing of any Company periodic report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, or the filing or furnishing of any Company Form 8-K that disclosed any material nonpublic information. # DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION Our general philosophy has historically been to qualify future compensation for tax deductibility wherever applicable and appropriate. Although a portion of the amount we recorded as compensation to our NEOs in 2024 was non-deductible, this did not have a significant impact to our income tax position. As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), the ability to rely on the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 162(m)\u201d) was generally eliminated, and the limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all NEOs (as well as certain former officers). As a result of the Tax Reform Act, after 2017 and subject to certain grandfathered provisions, we are no longer able to deduct any compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1 million. # COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation and Executive Development Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Proxy Statement with our management and, based on this review and discussion, recommended to the Board of Directors that it be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and this Proxy Statement.

All stock options are non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation method. The stock options generally vest over a three-year period (in equal annual installments) and have 10-year terms. The amounts shown represent the fair value of the RSU awards, the stock option grants and the PSU awards (at target) calculated in accordance with Topic 718 as of the date of the grant. The actual amount, if any, realized upon the exercise of stock options will depend upon the market price of our common shares relative to the exercise price per share of the stock option at the time of exercise. The actual amount realized upon vesting of RSUs will depend on the market price of our common shares at the time of vesting. The actual number and value of PSUs earned will be based upon our actual performance during the long-term incentive plan cycle and the market price at time of vesting. There is no assurance that the hypothetical full values of the awards will actually be realized. # NARRATIVE DISCLOSURE REGARDING 2024 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE AND 2024 GRANTS OF PLAN-BA The following highlights the salary and annual bonus percentages of total compensation reported in the 2024 Summary Compensation Table, based on the value of 2024 base salary and 2024 actual annual bonus (EMIP) for each of our NEOs:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d541ceb9-c5bf-4a1d-b44d-7d45cf2bfb29": {"__data__": {"id_": "d541ceb9-c5bf-4a1d-b44d-7d45cf2bfb29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1276ded2-29e7-4ade-a406-6307e4d51b27", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ff971ff1698e237157c79cc499db2df6c982da3dc325ddf0e27206213f2d0e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "568dd92c-527c-4d55-abe0-232b240e6b9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Name                 ': {0: ' Steven B.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION # Termination and Change in Control Arrangements The Key Compensation Programs table below highlights the standard benefits and payments available to NEOs in the event of a termination of employment and/or a change in control. The Termination and Change in Control Table below reflects the estimated additional amounts of compensation each NEO would receive in the event of a termination of employment and/or a change in control. Termination events include: a voluntary termination by the executive; normal retirement of the executive; an involuntary, not-for-cause termination by Lincoln Electric; a for-cause termination by Lincoln Electric; a termination upon a change in control; and a termination due to death or disability. In addition, estimated additional compensation amounts are shown in the event of a change in control without termination of employment. The amounts shown assume that each event occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of the calendar year. # TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT No written agreements exist that provide additional payments to a NEO in the event of a voluntary termination of employment with Lincoln Electric or a termination of employment initiated by Lincoln Electric (whether for cause or not). We do not have employment agreements or severance agreements, except for our change in control severance agreements described below. Pursuant to our standard employment policies, upon termination of employment, a NEO would be entitled to receive the same benefits and payments that are generally available to salaried employees:\n\n* Earned but unpaid base pay, up to the date of termination;\n* Earned and unused paid time off, up to the date of termination;\n* Vested amounts held in the executive\u2019s account under our 401(k) Plan;\n* Amounts held in the executive\u2019s account under our Top Hat Plan (based on the executive\u2019s election); and\n* Amounts held in the executive\u2019s account under our Restoration Plan.\n\n\\# CHANGE IN CONTROL We have entered into change in control severance agreements with our NEOs. Pursuant to our change in control severance agreements, in the event of a \u201cchange in control,\u201d if the NEO\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in the change in control severance agreement) or the NEO terminates employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as defined in the change in control severance agreement) during the severance period (as described below) (or for certain other employment terminations prior to and related to the change in control, as described in the change in control severance agreement), we will make severance payments and provide certain benefits as indicated in the Key Compensation Programs table below. The severance period commences on the date of the first occurrence of a change in control and ends on the earlier of (a) the second anniversary of the change in control, or (b) the executive\u2019s death. Our NEOs are required to abide by certain restrictive covenants and execute a release of claims in order to receive certain severance payments and benefits under the change in control severance agreements. The following events in general would constitute a change in control:\n\n* Any individual, entity or group is or becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of Lincoln Electric;\n* A majority of the Board ceases to be comprised of incumbent Directors;\n* Certain reorganizations, mergers or consolidations, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Lincoln Electric, or certain other corporate transactions are consummated;\n* Approval by the shareholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of Lincoln Electric.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3731, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

The table does not quantify benefits under plans that are generally available to salaried employees that do not discriminate in favor of NEOs, including the 401(k) Plan, the health care plan and the life insurance plan. The LTIP (Performance Shares) amounts include amounts for the 2023-2025 and 2024-2026 cycles, represented by the target amounts for the two cycles that were open as of the last business day of 2024. There is no amount included for either the 2024 Annual Bonus (EMIP) or the 2022-2024 cycle because both such awards were deemed to have been earned as of the last business day of the year. The following table assumes, in the event of a change in control, replacement awards are provided pursuant to the 2015 and 2023 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan\u2019s respective Stock Option Agreement, Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, and Performance Share Agreement (\u201cAgreements\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreements, if the respective equity awards are not replaced, all outstanding equity awards will accelerate as of the closing date of the change in control. In the event of a change in control where no replacement awards are provided, the accelerated equity values are consistent with the accelerated equity values under Change in Control (Replacement Awards; Qualified Termination). In addition, the table includes all equity that is accelerated as a result of termination but does not include the value of outstanding equity awards that have previously vested, such as stock options, which awards are set forth above in the Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31, 2024 table. For descriptions of the compensation plans and agreements that provide for the payments set forth in the following table, including our change in control agreements, see the \u201cElements of Executive Compensation\u201d discussion contained in the CD\\&A. Under the normal retirement scenario, the retirement definition is either at or after age 60 and 5 years of service or at or after age 55 and 15 years of service, and, as of December 31, 2024, three NEOs were eligible for normal retirement under the equity awards. The Annual Bonus (EMIP) has a retirement definition of either at or after age 55 and 25 years of service or at or after age 60 and 5 years of service, under which two NEOs were eligible for normal retirement as of December 31, 2024.

We note that, due to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions described below. In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, in calculating our CEO pay ratio for 2024, we believe there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. As a result, we have used the same median employee for determining the 2024 CEO pay ratio as we used to calculate the CEO pay ratio for 2023. In 2023, we determined our median employee based on total cash and equity compensation paid to our active employees as of October 1, 2023 for the period beginning on January 1, 2023. We included all full time, part time, seasonal and temporary employees, whether employed domestically or overseas and whether employed directly or by a consolidated subsidiary. Compensation for employees hired during 2023 was annualized for all employees other than temporary or seasonal employees (and full-time equivalencies were not created). Annual total compensation for the median employee for 2024 was calculated using the same methodology used for our NEOs as set forth in the 2024 Summary Compensation Table.

Therefore, we have established a program that ties executive compensation to superior financial performance. 104 LINCOLN ELECTRIC 2025 PROXY STATEMENT", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdccdb56-4058-41d1-93ee-6019e316d096": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdccdb56-4058-41d1-93ee-6019e316d096", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fce67080-e7bc-4ded-84f3-aabeaa113fd3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0ef43b0f2ca6484f47f47cfa897205008dac1eaaa5a40d307702ce292e17fc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# ANNUAL MEETING PROPOSALS We have a balanced pay mix between short-term and long-term incentives:\n\n* **Base Salaries.** Base salaries for our NEOs are generally targeted at the 45th percentile of benchmark data (below market median). For 2024, the average base salary increase for the NEOs, excluding Mr. Hedlund and Mr. Mapes in light of the CEO transition, was 6.4%, which included the progression of pay within the competitive benchmark for recently promoted executives.\n* **Performance Share Payouts Were Above Target.** For the 2022-2024 performance cycle, the Performance Shares paid out above target, as a result of the maximum performance level for ROIC for Compensation Purposes and the above target performance level for Adjusted Net Income for Compensation Purposes.\n* **Long-Term Incentives Are Aligned with the Interests of Our Shareholders.** We believe that incentives should be based on factors that deliver long-term sustainability for Lincoln Electric. Therefore, the NEOs receive three types of long-term incentives. The three components are: (1) stock options, (2) RSUs and (3) Performance Shares. Total awards are targeted at the 50th percentile of benchmark data (at market median).\n\nThe total cash compensation for our NEOs, which includes base pay and the annual bonus (EMIP), is targeted at the 65th percentile of benchmark data (above market median). The EMIP is based on a balance of metrics\u2014both financial and personal\u2014with the financial components based on Adjusted Revenue for Compensation Purposes, EBITB and AOWC/ Sales for Compensation Purposes and with a mix of consolidated and, if applicable, segment performance. For 2024, annual bonus payments for the NEOs decreased 62%. # GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES In addition to our emphasis on pay for performance, we design our programs to be current with best practices and good corporate governance. We also consider the risks associated with any particular program, design or compensation decision. We believe these assessments result in sustained, long-term shareholder value. Some of the governance practices include:\n\n* Officers Are Subject to Stock Ownership Guidelines\n* Compliant Clawback Policy\n* Compensation and Executive Development Committee Receives Regular Updates\n* Compensation and Executive Development Committee Retains Independent Advisors\n* No Compensation Consultant Conflicts of Interest\n* No Multi-Year Guarantees on Compensation\n* No Dividends on Unvested RSUs or Performance Shares\n* Change in Control Agreements Require a Double-Trigger\n* No Tax Gross-Ups\n* No Hedging or Pledging of Lincoln Electric Stock by Officers\n* Limited Perquisites\n\nAs illustrated above, the Compensation and Executive Development Committee has and will continue to take action to structure our executive compensation program in a manner that is performance-based, current with best practices and good corporate governance and aimed at sustaining long-term shareholder value. The Board believes that the executive compensation disclosed in the CD\\&A section, tabular disclosures (including the 2024 Summary Compensation Table) and other narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement aligns with our peer group pay practices and compensation philosophy.

The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements in the Annual Report, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and letter from the independent auditors required by the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors\u2019 communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence as required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. The Audit Committee discussed with our internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plan for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our internal controls, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee and the Board have also recommended the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2025 and the ratification thereof by the shareholders.

Some of these metrics are considered Non-GAAP financial measures, as management uses various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in assessing and evaluating our underlying operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), as non-GAAP measures are a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. The following defines the financial and non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the CD\\&A and other sections of this Proxy Statement. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements and financial measures to conform to current year classifications. # ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is defined as reported Diluted Earnings Per Share excluding certain disclosed special items. # ADJUSTED EBIT Adjusted EBIT is defined as reported EBIT excluding certain disclosed special items. # ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as reported Effective Tax Rate excluding the tax effect of certain disclosed special items. # ADJUSTED NET INCOME Adjusted Net Income is defined as reported Net Income excluding certain disclosed special items. # ADJUSTED NET INCOME FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES Adjusted Net Income for Compensation Purposes is defined as reported Net Income excluding certain disclosed special items and other adjustments as approved by the Compensation and Executive Development Committee. # ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME Adjusted Operating Income is defined as reported Operating Income excluding certain disclosed special items. # ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME INCREMENTAL MARGIN Adjusted Operating Income Incremental Margin is defined as the change in Adjusted Operating Income between two periods divided by the change in Net sales between the same two periods. # ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME MARGIN Adjusted Operating Income Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by Net sales.\n\nLINCOLN ELECTRIC | 2025 PROXY STATEMENT A-1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2705, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e651c6dd-87ed-45d4-8292-b1fc6bc5b51a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e651c6dd-87ed-45d4-8292-b1fc6bc5b51a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7bdc02d-9310-467f-a1bc-af2b541ec0af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cd169d04948cdd3affc4221af7afa6dfb1a9b5e0ed9f72de50350947ae06a29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# APPENDIX A # ADJUSTED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ADJUSTED ROIC) Adjusted ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital. # ADJUSTED REVENUE FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES (ADJUSTED REVENUE) Adjusted Revenue for Compensation Purposes is defined as Net sales calculated at budgeted exchange rates and adjusted for the results of businesses acquired during the year. Additionally, a price collar may be approved by the Committee to limit the impact of pricing on the metric, resulting in growth of the metric focusing primarily on organic sales volumes. For 2023 and 2024, a +/- 2% price collar was approved by the Compensation and Executive Development Committee for use when calculating this metric. The price collar limits the impact of either price increases or decreases to 2%. Net sales is a representative measure of Adjusted Revenue for Compensation Purposes. # AVERAGE OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES (AOWC/SALES) Average operating working capital to Net Sales (AOWC/Sales) is defined as the sum of Accounts receivable, Inventories and contract assets less Trade accounts payable and contract liabilities as of a period end divided by annualized rolling three months of Net sales. # AVERAGE OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES (AOWC/SALES FOR COMP) Average operating working capital to Net Sales for Compensation Purposes (AOWC/Sales for Compensation Purposes) is defined as the sum of Accounts receivable, Inventories (excluding LIFO inventory reserves) and contract assets less Trade accounts payable and contract liabilities as of a period end divided by annualized rolling three months of Net sales. # CASH CONVERSION Cash Conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted Net Income. # EBIT EBIT is an amount equal to earnings before interest and tax defined as operating income plus Other income (expense). # EBITB EBITB is an amount equal to earnings before interest, tax and bonus, calculated at budgeted exchange rates and adjusted for special items as determined by management. The adjustments for special items include such items as rationalization charges, certain asset impairment charges, the gains and losses on certain transactions including the disposal of assets and the results of businesses acquired during the year. Adjusted Operating Income is a representative measure of EBITB. # FREE CASH FLOW (FCF) Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures. # ORGANIC SALES Organic Sales is defined as sales excluding the effects of foreign currency and acquisitions. # RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) Return on invested capital (ROIC) is defined as rolling 12 months of Net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital. # RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES ROIC for Compensation Purposes is calculated by an independent third-party and is adjusted for certain transactions as approved by the Compensation and Executive Development Committee.

BUSINESS # General As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term \"Company,\" except as otherwise indicated by the context, means Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest. The Lincoln Electric Company began operations in 1895 and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1906. During 1998, The Lincoln Electric Company reorganized into a holding company structure, and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. became the publicly-held parent of Lincoln Electric subsidiaries worldwide, including The Lincoln Electric Company. The Company is the world leader in the design, development and manufacture of arc welding solutions, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxyfuel cutting equipment, and has a leading global position in brazing and soldering alloys. The Company\u2019s products include arc welding, brazing and soldering filler metals (consumables), arc welding equipment, plasma and oxyfuel cutting systems, wire feeding systems, fume control equipment, welding accessories, specialty gas regulators, and education solutions; as well as a comprehensive portfolio of automated solutions for joining, cutting, material handling, module assembly, and end of line testing. The arc welding power sources and wire feeding systems manufactured by the Company range in technology from basic units used for light manufacturing and maintenance to highly sophisticated robotic applications for high volume production welding and fabrication. Three primary types of arc welding consumables are produced: (1) coated manual or stick electrodes; (2) solid wire produced in coil, reel or drum forms for continuous feeding in mechanized welding; and (3) cored wire produced in coil form for continuous feeding in mechanized welding. The Company has, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Company\u2019s business units are aligned into three operating segments. The operating segments consist of Americas Welding, International Welding and The Harris Products Group. The Americas Welding segment includes welding operations in North and South America. The International Welding segment includes welding operations in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The Harris Products Group includes the Company\u2019s global cutting, soldering and brazing businesses, specialty gas equipment, as well as the retail business in the United States. # Customers The Company\u2019s products are sold in both domestic and international markets. In the Americas, products are sold principally through industrial distributors, retailers and also directly to users of welding products (OEMs, manufacturers and integrators). Outside of the Americas, the Company has an international sales organization comprised of Company employees and agents who sell products from the Company\u2019s various manufacturing sites to distributors and product users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a931eccc-ba81-4817-a1ca-e460d0350521": {"__data__": {"id_": "a931eccc-ba81-4817-a1ca-e460d0350521", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99ee2414-59a4-4508-8110-3c9d762a0187", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "818cedd1807aca82359f2aacec6ddd944c2b4b0d629c0a6f89e13b5ef7f4edc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# The Company\u2019s major end-user markets include:\n\n* general fabrication,\n* energy (oil and gas, power generation and process industries),\n* heavy industries (heavy fabrication, ship building and maintenance and repair),\n* automotive and transportation, and\n* construction and infrastructure.\n\nThe Company is not dependent on a single customer or a few customers and no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total Net sales. However, the loss of a large customer could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including an increase in interest rates, inflationary pressures and fluctuations in foreign currency rates. The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature. Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by economic cycles and the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for further discussion regarding risks associated with customers, general economic conditions and demand. # Competition Conditions in the arc welding and cutting industry are highly competitive. The Company believes it is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of consumables and equipment with relatively few major broad-line competitors worldwide, but numerous smaller competitors in specific geographic markets. The Company continues to pursue strategies to heighten its competitiveness in domestic and international markets, which includes positioning low cost manufacturing facilities in most geographical markets. Competition in the arc welding and cutting industry is based on brand preference, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support. The Company believes its performance against these factors has contributed to the Company\u2019s position as the leader in the industry. Most of the Company\u2019s products may be classified as standard commercial articles and are manufactured for stock. The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of its highly trained technical sales force and the support of its welding research and development staff to assist customers in optimizing their welding applications. This allows the Company to introduce its products to new users and to establish and maintain close relationships with its customers. This close relationship between the technical sales force and the direct customers, together with its supportive relationship with its distributors, who are particularly interested in handling the broad range of the Company\u2019s products, is an important element of the Company\u2019s market success and a valuable asset of the Company. # Raw Materials The principal raw materials essential to the Company\u2019s business are steel, electronic components, engines, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, robotic components and various chemicals, all of which are normally available for purchase in the open market. # Patents and Trademarks The Company holds many valuable patents, primarily in arc welding, and actively protects its innovations as research and development has progressed in both the United States and major international jurisdictions. The Company believes its trademarks are an important asset and aggressively pursues brand management. # Environmental Regulations The Company\u2019s facilities are subject to environmental regulations. To date, compliance with these environmental regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s earnings.

RISK FACTORS From time to time, information we provide, statements by our employees or information included in our filings with the SEC may contain forward-looking statements that are not historical facts. Those statements are \u201cforward-looking\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cguidance\u201d or words of similar meaning. Actual results may differ materially from such statements due to a variety of factors that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Forward-looking statements, and our future performance, operating results, financial position and liquidity, are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect results, including those risks described below. Forward-looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date of the statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update those statements. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks. We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks. Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible. Our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks. The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them. Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value. However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.

Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Recessionary economic cycles, global supply chain disruptions, higher logistics costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher raw materials costs, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or trade laws or other economic factors and other challenges affecting the countries and industries in which we do business, including, but not limited to, the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, could adversely affect demand for our products. An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other governments. Any further changes in the United States or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States. As a growing global enterprise, the share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant. This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States. If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations, including:\n\n* Political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil;\n* Corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, tariffs, data protection and privacy requirements, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Convention);\n* International terrorism and hostilities;\n* Changes in the global regulatory environment, including revised or newly created laws, regulations or standards relating to the Company, our products or the markets in which we operate; and\n* Significant fluctuations in relative currency values; in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, as well as the imposition of exchange controls, currency devaluations and hyperinflation.\n\nThe cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance. The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature. Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.

Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, pandemics, labor disputes and natural disasters, including events caused by climate change. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses. Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our business. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacturing of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas). The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions. They are also influenced by import duties and tariffs speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, government trade practices and regulations and other factors. Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass these cost increases along to our customers or reduce our cost of goods sold. Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business. We are subject to risks relating to our information systems and data. The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information systems, which contain confidential information related to our customers, suppliers and employees and other proprietary business information. We maintain some of these systems and are also dependent on a number of critical information technology and other infrastructure services provided by third parties relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and finance functions. Like many companies, our information systems and those of third parties who provide products or services to us may be subject to cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents and similar attacks vary in their form and can include the deployment of harmful malware or ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and other attacks, which may affect business continuity and threaten the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our systems and information. Cybersecurity incidents can also include employee or personnel failures, fraud, phishing or other social engineering attempts or other methods to cause confidential information, payments, account access or access credentials, or other data to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Cybersecurity threat actors also may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in software that is commonly used by companies in cloud-based services and bundled software. To date, no such cybersecurity incidents have had a material impact on our business or operations. However, cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity incidents or disruptions involving our systems or those of our third-party business partners, or any failure by us or our third-party business partners to effectively address, enforce or maintain our information systems could interrupt our ability to manage and operate the business, impact data, and adversely affect our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, alteration or corruption of data or systems, costs related to remediation and recovery, and litigation including individual claims or consumer class actions, commercial litigation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e36b1a8-7642-400a-8c59-9b53151c08cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e36b1a8-7642-400a-8c59-9b53151c08cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de567388-2032-4b37-b52a-2265c3790895", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f5f42b9d260f9061ecb25f483b1f0c7ee0c07d97faf3da442b0cdd613924a22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "administrative, and civil or criminal investigations or actions, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigation and remediation costs and possible prolonged negative publicity. The Company continues to invest in cybersecurity, including measures intended to maintain and enhance cybersecurity resilience, and the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks are regularly monitored by the Audit Committee of our Board. Nevertheless, due to the nature of cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our preventive efforts can fully mitigate the risks of all cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition. We may be incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into our products, services and processes. These technologies may present business, compliance and reputational risks. The introduction of artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and machine-learning technologies, particularly generative AI, into internal processes, third-party services and/or new and existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, including due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results. In addition, our personnel could, unbeknownst to us, improperly utilize AI and machine learning-technology while carrying out their responsibilities. The use of AI in third-party services and the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity. The use of artificial intelligence can lead to unintended consequences, including generating content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate, misleading or otherwise flawed, or that results in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, which could harm our reputation and business and expose us to risks related to inaccuracies or errors in the output of such technologies. # Risks Related to Human Capital Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical (including research and development) personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense and compensation rates are increasing due to lower labor availability. Under these conditions, we may not succeed in identifying, attracting or retaining qualified personnel. With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool. Any interruption of our workforce, including rationalization efforts related to the integration of acquired businesses, interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition. # Risks Related to Business Strategy We may not be able to complete our acquisition or divestiture strategies, successfully integrate acquired businesses and, in certain cases, we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters. Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us. Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition. Integration efforts may include significant rationalization activities that could be disruptive to the business.

Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations. If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenues, gross margins and results of operations may suffer. Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics. We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive. We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will be met with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth. Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours. We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage. Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position. Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products. The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, results of operations and prospects. We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products. We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support. We have previously initiated, and may initiate in the future, significant rationalization activities to align our business with market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness, including with respect to the integration of acquired businesses. Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our revenue, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available. Our competitive position could be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.

In addition, in certain markets of the world, distributors manufacture and sell arc welding products. Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this increased competition. We may incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate rationalization actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure, and, as a result, we may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. We may take additional actions in the future to further optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but are not limited to asset impairments, employee severance costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension settlements, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future rationalization plans in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding rationalization plans, refer to the rationalization and asset impairment related disclosure under Note 7 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. # Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness. Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition. As of December 31, 2024, we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 1,300 plaintiffs. In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants. The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers. Asbestos use in welding consumables in the United States ceased in 1981. Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 57,080 of those claims were dismissed, 23 were tried to defense verdicts, 7 were tried to plaintiff verdicts (which were reversed or resolved after appeal), 1 was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 1,018 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions. The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers. While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience. We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us or failure to meet contractual performance commitments. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell. Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects. We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage. Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a82c149-090c-46fa-8192-adb621c4ab8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a82c149-090c-46fa-8192-adb621c4ab8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb94f316-fd29-441b-821c-8e0a6af3b572", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9cb626bfe70894aa3d6e03d48017836fb6004c0a2873a954f8dd4124503b66f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "cases, we design automated welding systems for use in a customer\u2019s production facilities (including automotive production facilities), which could expose us to financial losses or professional liability.

We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims. Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. Even if we are successful defending such claims or product liability coverage is adequate, claims of this nature could cause customers to lose confidence in our products and our Company. Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance, and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed. We may incur losses if we do not achieve contractual commitments, including project performance requirements or project schedules. Project performance can be affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, availability of materials, changes in the project scope of services, environmental conditions or labor disruptions.

Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. In addition, there is uncertainty in changes to the U.S. tax rate due to the new U.S. presidential administration. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the United States and the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the 15% global minimum tax under The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) Pillar Two, Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (the \u201cPillar Two Rules\u201d), will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by the U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Evolving international laws and enforcement relating to data privacy could adversely affect our operations. Our business is also subject to increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. Laws and regulations addressing personal information, including with respect to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), U.S. state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur ongoing costs as part of our efforts to comply with applicable law. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with data protection or privacy-related legal obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigating costs, consumer", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4709, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f461a46-949d-459f-968d-d256c64922fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f461a46-949d-459f-968d-d256c64922fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eb924d8f-08c3-4407-a43c-04120b63bda0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "418bd12250406f2ad9f07371c56126230968c19c566950a61a7924ddb10c34da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "class actions or commercial litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements. We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, it could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily. We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. A number of governments and agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions have proposed and may continue to introduce regulatory changes to address climate change, including regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions. We may be subject to additional regulations or restrictions in jurisdictions where we operate, including charges to fund additional energy-efficient activities, assessments or fees, and operational restrictions such as reduced emission allowances. Compliance with climate change regulations and restrictions may result in additional costs, including increased production costs and taxes, which could adversely impact our financial position. In addition, climate change regulations and related operating restrictions may unfavorably affect our competitive position with companies who may not be subject to equivalent requirements in their jurisdictions. In addition, negative publicity or public perception of climate change issues associated with us or our industry may cause reputational damage and financial harm to the Company. # ITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY # Risk Management and Strategy Our cybersecurity risk management process is integrated into our ERM process as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Cybersecurity has been identified as a critical risk. To identify, assess, and manage material cybersecurity risks, we regularly evaluate and take steps to enhance our cybersecurity protocols to protect against or mitigate cyber threats. We conduct third-party and internal assessments of our environments, including system penetration testing, test our recovery and response processes, and we consider industry standards when developing our information security program. The Company has an information security training program, which calls for training all computer-based employees through various employee training modules relative to information security matters and phishing simulation events with employees to raise cybersecurity awareness. From time to time, we engage third-party assessors, consultants, auditors and others to assist us with evaluating, enhancing, implementing and monitoring our cybersecurity risk-management programs. We maintain processes to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers such as contract and vendor due diligence review, as well as annual review of the service providers\u2019 independent audit report where applicable. Like many companies, our systems and those of our third party providers who provide us with services and products may be subject to cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents. To date, no such cybersecurity incidents have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, if as a result of any future incidents our systems are significantly damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cybersecurity incident, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company maintains an insurance policy with respect to cybersecurity and has undergone several simulation, preparedness and response exercises. See \u201cRisks Related to Manufacturing and Operations\u201d in Item 1A. Risk Factors. # Governance Our Board oversees the management of our risks, including risks from cybersecurity threats, on an enterprise-wide basis, and the Lead Independent Director promotes our Board\u2019s engagement in this process. Our Board has delegated oversight of the risk assessment and mitigation process with respect to cybersecurity to the Audit Committee of our Board. The Audit Committee regularly monitors the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks and receives updates from the Chief Information Officer (\u201cCIO\u201d) at each meeting. In addition, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the overall effectiveness of the information technology security environment as part of quarterly updates provided by the CIO. The CIO reports to the full Board about cybersecurity on an annual basis. Our CIO has over 25 years of experience in the Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and cybersecurity industry. The CIO is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including monitoring the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. On at least a quarterly basis, the CIO chairs the IT Governance Committee, which includes the executive management team. The purpose of this committee is to inform and make strategic decisions on IT-related matters, including the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. In addition, the CIO regularly reviews key cybersecurity risk metrics and reporting designed to measure the effectiveness of related processes and procedures as part of quarterly updates to the Audit Committee. The CIO utilizes this information in her reporting to the Board and Audit Committee of the Board.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4010, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f672e9-87e8-44fc-b9d0-4a7112fd3218": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f672e9-87e8-44fc-b9d0-4a7112fd3218", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f89a9ba3-ed48-467e-8080-cd5fae36da6d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "242e83ee11b44b060892aba7231ff8daf2b595ff9152a2be29e3d508a8037115", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5bbe458-f118-4608-9660-c97353bc7791", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Name\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Age\nType: integer\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Position\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "999bee2c52e4d67a6bb2980692ce7a4c3843c1e7a9f34ec84165130d2dd432ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# ITEM 1D.

Management anticipates we will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets. The Company continues to expand globally and periodically consider acquisitions that would involve significant investments. The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market. The Company\u2019s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding. Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the United States, and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary needing or requiring funding.

Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Amounts due banks, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1426, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16aa0684-2c7a-4f03-b828-82d334358a1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "16aa0684-2c7a-4f03-b828-82d334358a1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "715f2a8d-203d-4b65-9e63-23452fa52eba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d53f7e65521c6c76f3c80a6b2117362100a84d0f83d586b25e47f444729130bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ed68594-0f83-445d-b9e4-a0302dc5f7f4", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Return on Invested Capital\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: 2024\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: 2023\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "28259321b3a5f6ff420da1b99944be702dfa4252046dd7eaceee026cd7a91b70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# The following table presents the reconciliation of ROIC and Adjusted ROIC to net income:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 91, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ebd2c96-ac08-49d1-af56-6f7a074e35e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ebd2c96-ac08-49d1-af56-6f7a074e35e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "715f2a8d-203d-4b65-9e63-23452fa52eba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d53f7e65521c6c76f3c80a6b2117362100a84d0f83d586b25e47f444729130bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19e490f3-fd11-415a-8b0f-a93275d40ce5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Return on Invested Capital                               ': {0: ' Net income as reported                                   ', 1: ' Plus: Interest expense (after-tax)                       ', 2: ' Less: Interest income (after-tax)                        ', 3: ' Net operating profit after taxes                         ', 4: ' Special items:                                           ', 5: ' Rationalization and asset impairment net charges         ', 6: ' Acquisition transaction costs                            ', 7: ' Pension settlement net charges                           ', 8: ' Amortization of step up in value of acquired inventories ', 9: ' Loss (gain) on asset disposal                            ', 10: ' Tax effect of Special items (1)                          ', 11: ' Adjusted net operating profit after taxes                ', 12: ' Invested Capital                                         ', 13: ' Short-term debt                                          ', 14: ' Long-term debt, less current portion                     ', 15: ' Total debt                                               ', 16: ' Total equity                                             ', 17: ' Invested capital                                         ', 18: ' Return on invested capital as reported                   ', 19: ' Adjusted return on invested capital                      '}, ' 2024        ': {0: ' $ 466,108   ', 1: ' 39,665      ', 2: ' 7,593       ', 3: ' $ 498,180   ', 4: '             ', 5: ' 55,860      ', 6: ' 7,042       ', 7: ' 3,792       ', 8: ' 5,026       ', 9: ' 4,950       ', 10: ' (11,513)    ', 11: ' $ 563,337   ', 12: '             ', 13: ' $ 110,524   ', 14: ' 1,150,551   ', 15: ' 1,261,075   ', 16: ' 1,327,433   ', 17: ' $ 2,588,508 ', 18: ' 19.2 %      ', 19: ' 21.8 %      '}, ' 2023        ': {0: ' $ 545,248   ', 1: ' 38,050      ', 2: ' 5,033       ', 3: ' $ 578,265   ', 4: '             ', 5: ' (11,314)    ', 6: ' \u2014           ', 7: ' 845         ', 8: ' 12,252      ', 9: ' (1,646)     ', 10: ' 2,537       ', 11: ' $ 580,939   ', 12: '             ', 13: ' $ 2,439     ', 14: ' 1,102,771   ', 15: ' 1,105,210   ', 16: ' 1,308,852   ', 17: ' $ 2,414,062 ', 18: ' 24.0 %      ', 19: ' 24.1 %      '}}", "table_summary": "The table provides a detailed breakdown of the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for the years 2023 and 2024.

The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred. The long-term impact of product liability contingencies, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers. Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims. # New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. # Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used. If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated. Historically, the Company\u2019s estimates have been determined to be reasonable.

The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations. # Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, administrative claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses. The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred. Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period. With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome. The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience. If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation. Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly. Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made. Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change. Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims. Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves. The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions. The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published. The Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain income tax positions in various jurisdictions. The Company uses judgment in determining whether the technical merits of tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. Judgment is also used in measuring the related amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition, including the interpretation of applicable tax law, regulation and tax ruling. Liabilities are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of the statute of limitations. Liabilities can be affected by changes in applicable tax law, regulations, tax rulings or such other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate. Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for uncertain income tax positions; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of uncertain income tax positions. # Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The Company will repatriate earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to foreign withholding taxes. The Company considers any remaining earnings and outside basis in all other non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and has not recorded any deferred taxes as such estimate is not practicable. At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $207,739 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards, which may reduce taxable income in future years. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more-likely-than-not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. At December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $35,284 was recorded against certain deferred tax assets based on this assessment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb7942e2-3de5-4a50-abfe-3683aab84c23": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb7942e2-3de5-4a50-abfe-3683aab84c23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "682d9ba0-adac-4eff-94af-89117f0be695", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "abe74a3a69321e91d54d0b590ae6fce0eb980a82da28a44e22f223a58ac68f2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company\u2019s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes. # Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs. Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a LIFO basis. LIFO was used for 35% and 37% of total inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a FIFO basis. The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management\u2019s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Actual year-end inventory levels and costs may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations. The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $120,633 and $129,946 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors. If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company\u2019s estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required. Historically, the Company\u2019s reserves have approximated actual experience. # Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets, including leases and intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives, to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. # Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same date each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is only required if the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company may also perform a quantitative test in instances where the more-likely-than-not threshold has not been met, including when general macroeconomic conditions or changes to the reporting unit warrant a refresh of the baseline used in a qualitative test. For quantitative testing, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates to value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4349, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a807a427-00b3-4f69-be2b-45d976a3b380": {"__data__": {"id_": "a807a427-00b3-4f69-be2b-45d976a3b380", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0fc9376f-49fe-4bef-a36b-d384849557ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84e43288f2465196ee226dc62b8e1ec3c2847e304e0e581d8ff4c2b0677936bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# Acquisitions Upon acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate. The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely on estimates and assumptions. Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and royalty rates). Acquired inventories are marked to fair value. For certain items, the pre-acquisition carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to the Company. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. # Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s sales arrangements are short-term in nature involving a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer based upon shipping terms. In addition, certain customized automation performance obligations are accounted for over time. Under this method, revenue recognition is primarily based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete. The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses. Approximately 10% of the Company\u2019s Net sales are recognized over time. The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded. Taxes collected by the Company, including sales tax and value added tax, are excluded from Net sales. The Company recognizes freight billed as a component of Net sales and shipping costs as a component of Cost of goods sold when control transfers to the customer. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is generally one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. # ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company\u2019s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The Company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures. The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company hedged certain third-party and intercompany purchases and sales. The gross notional dollar amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2024 was $96,444. At December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $785. The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross-border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date. The gross notional dollar amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2024 was $421,754. A hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease to Income before income taxes of $17,271 related to these positions. However, any loss (or gain) resulting from a hypothetical 10% change would be offset by the associated gain (or loss) on the underlying balance sheet exposure and would ultimately not materially affect the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company also has a foreign currency forward contract hedge designated as a net investment hedge with a notional dollar amount of $319,450 at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, any loss (or gain) resulting from the hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $32,617. The fair value of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 approximated cost due to the short-term duration. These financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments. The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations. # ITEM 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. # Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. # Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

The purchase price, net of cash acquired, in connection with the acquisition was $108,844, of which a portion was allocated to goodwill. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. Auditing the Company\u2019s purchase price allocation was complex due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of three of the identifiable intangible assets, which were a significant input in determining the amount of the total purchase price allocated to goodwill. These fair value estimates were sensitive to certain significant assumptions, specifically the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Elements of these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future market or economic conditions. # How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the Company\u2019s purchase price allocation process. For example, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the significant assumptions described above along with the completeness and accuracy of the data used in these fair value estimates. To test the estimated fair value of the relevant identifiable intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the fair value methodologies, testing the significant assumptions described above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to the revenue growth rates, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical results of the acquired business, third party industry data and economic trends. We involved valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology applied and the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management, including, the discount rates used to value the relevant identifiable intangible assets. Specifically, we evaluated the components of the discount rate assumptions used by performing an independent corroborative analysis with involvement of valuation specialists. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate any hypothetical changes in the fair values of the relevant identifiable intangible assets that would result from changes in the significant assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since at least 1923, but we are unable to determine the specific year.

In our opinion, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Superior Controls, LLC (\u201cRedViking\u201d), Inrotech A/S (\u201cInrotech\u201d) and Vanair Manufacturing, LLC (\u201cVanair\u201d), which are included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 8% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2.5% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of RedViking, Inrotech or Vanair. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. # Basis for Opinion The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. # Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, none of which are material. # General Information The Company is the world leader in the design, development and manufacture of arc welding products, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment. The Company also has a leading global position in brazing and soldering alloys. The Company\u2019s products include arc welding, brazing and soldering filler metals (consumables), arc welding equipment, plasma and oxyfuel cutting systems, wire feeding systems, fume control equipment, welding accessories, specialty gas regulators, and education solutions; as well as a comprehensive portfolio of automated solutions for joining, cutting, material handling, module assembly, and end of line testing. In March 2022, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Company announced it was ceasing operations in Russia and implementing plans to support its Russian employees. In May 2024, the Company disposed of its Russian entity and completed its exit from the Russian market. As a result, $22,566 of cumulative translation adjustment previously recognized within Other comprehensive income (loss) was recorded to Rationalization and asset impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year ended December 31, 2024. # Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income. An economy is considered highly inflationary under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) if the cumulative inflation rate for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Turkish economy exceeded the three-year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent during the second quarter of 2022. As a result, the financial statements of the Company\u2019s Turkish operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of April 1, 2022. Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company\u2019s Turkish operation have been remeasured into the Company\u2019s reporting currency (U.S. dollar).

The Company records a right-of-use asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets to represent its right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The Company records a lease liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets to represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company\u2019s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date to present value the lease payments. The Company has operating leases for sales offices, manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, transportation equipment, office equipment and information technology equipment. Some of these leases are noncancelable. Variable or short-term lease costs contained within the Company\u2019s operating leases are not material. Most leases include one or more options to renew, which can extend the lease term from 1 to 11 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company\u2019s sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. # Impairments The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets and finite-lived intangible assets, to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Refer to Notes 5, 7 and 17 for additional details. # Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life. These types of assets are assessed for impairment in a manner consistent with long-lived assets described above. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same date each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. In performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is only required if the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company may also perform a quantitative test in instances where the more-likely-than-not threshold has not been met, including when general macroeconomic conditions or changes to the reporting unit warrant a refresh of the baseline used in a qualitative test. For quantitative testing, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount.

The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer generally based upon shipping terms. In addition, certain customized automation performance obligations are accounted for over time. Under this method, revenue recognition is primarily based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete. The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses. Approximately 10% of the Company\u2019s Net sales are recognized over time. The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded. Taxes collected by the Company, including sales tax and value added tax, are excluded from Net sales. The Company recognizes freight billed as a component of Net sales and shipping costs as a component of Cost of goods sold when control transfers to the customer.

Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. # Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, commodity prices and currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain purchase and sales transactions, balance sheet and net investment exposures. Derivative contracts to hedge currency and commodity exposures are generally written on a short-term basis, but may cover exposures for up to 3 years while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued. The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments. Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions. The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by monitoring the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty. # Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts and commodity contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the fair value unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other assets, Other current liabilities or Other liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract. At settlement, the realized gain or loss is recorded in Cost of goods sold or Net sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

The Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain income tax positions in various jurisdictions. The Company uses judgment in determining whether the technical merits of tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained.

The Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,564 in 2023 which is recorded in Rationalization and asset impairment charges in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets for each of the next five years is $27,172 in 2025, $25,821 in 2026, $24,936 in 2027, $24,142 in 2028 and $20,570 in 2029. # NOTE 6 \u2013 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company\u2019s primary business is the design, development and manufacture of arc welding products, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment. The Company also has a leading global position in brazing and soldering alloys. The Company\u2019s products include arc welding, brazing and soldering filler metals (consumables), arc welding equipment, plasma and oxyfuel cutting systems, wire feeding systems, fume control equipment, welding accessories, specialty gas regulators, and education solutions; as well as a comprehensive portfolio of automated solutions for joining, cutting, material handling, module assembly, and end of line testing. The Company has aligned its organizational and leadership structure into three operating segments to support growth strategies and enhance the utilization of the Company\u2019s worldwide resources and global sourcing initiatives. The operating segments consist of Americas Welding, International Welding and The Harris Products Group. The Americas Welding segment includes welding operations in North and South America. The International Welding segment includes welding operations in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The Harris Products Group includes the Company\u2019s global cutting, soldering and brazing businesses, specialty gas equipment, as well as its retail business in the United States. Segment performance is measured and resources are allocated based on a number of factors, the primary measure being the adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes (\"Adjusted EBIT\") profit measure. EBIT is defined as Operating income plus Other income. Segment EBIT is adjusted for special items as determined by management such as the impact of rationalization activities, certain asset impairment charges and gains or losses on disposals of assets. The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment Adjusted EBIT to allocate resources for each segment predominantly in establishing the Company\u2019s long-term strategy and in developing the annual budget. The CODM considers actual performance using Adjusted EBIT when making decisions about allocating capital and resources to the segments. The accounting principles applied at the operating segment level are generally the same as those applied at the consolidated financial statement level with the exception of LIFO. Segment assets include inventories measured on a FIFO basis while consolidated inventories include inventories reported on a LIFO basis. Segment and consolidated income before interest and income taxes include the effect of inventories reported on a LIFO basis. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 approximately 35%, 37% and 38%, respectively, of total inventories were valued using the LIFO method. LIFO is used for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories included in Americas Welding. Inter-segment sales are recorded at agreed upon prices that approximate arm\u2019s length prices and are eliminated in consolidation. Corporate-level expenses are allocated to the operating segments.

During 2023, the Company also initiated rationalization plans within International Welding. The plans in both years impacted headcount and included the consolidation of manufacturing facilities to better align with the cost structure, economic conditions and operating needs. As a result of these plans, in 2024 the Company recorded Rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $32,960 in International Welding, of which $22,566 is associated with the disposal of the Company\u2019s Russian entity. The Company also incurred Rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $18,840 and $3,955 in Americas Welding and The Harris Products Group, respectively, in 2024. In 2023, the Company recorded a Rationalization and asset impairment net gain of $11,782 in International Welding and a net charge $468 in Americas Welding. In 2022, the Company recorded Rationalization and asset impairment net charge of $11,788 primarily related to International Welding. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, liabilities of $14,146 and $15,086, respectively, were recognized in Other current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not anticipate significant additional charges related to the completion of these plans. The Company believes the rationalization actions will positively impact future results of operations and will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital. The Company continues to evaluate its cost structure and additional rationalization actions may result in charges in future periods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1738, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75e2caf7-ea47-43c9-8c58-9f9c1596f071": {"__data__": {"id_": "75e2caf7-ea47-43c9-8c58-9f9c1596f071", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd86045d-2e71-4947-a6f6-f90c175027a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1074ce64eddc1da01c481ab89711cd7e68ef9af7b32f93ddc022db909f6d125", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "259fb7a6-e9e5-4279-a09f-8d7b88e4139e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Balance at December 31, 2022   ': {0: ' $2,207                         ', 1: ' Payments and other adjustments ', 2: ' Charged to expense             ', 3: ' Balance at December 31, 2023   ', 4: ' Payments and other adjustments ', 5: ' Charged to expense             ', 6: ' Balance at December 31, 2024   '}, ' International Welding ': {0: ' $0                    ', 1: ' (468)                 ', 2: ' 468                   ', 3: ' $15,086               ', 4: '                       ', 5: '                       ', 6: ' $5,628                '}, ' The Harris Products Group ': {0: ' $2,207                    ', 1: ' (6,747)                   ', 2: ' 19,626                    ', 3: ' $0                        ', 4: ' (11,957)                  ', 5: ' 17,585                    ', 6: ' $7,562                    '}, ' Consolidated ': {0: '              ', 1: ' (7,215)      ', 2: ' 20,094       ', 3: ' $15,086      ', 4: ' (21,893)     ', 5: ' 14,369       ', 6: ' $956         '}, '         ': {0: '         ', 1: '         ', 2: '         ', 3: '         ', 4: ' (2,063) ', 5: ' 3,019   ', 6: ' $14,146 '}, '          ': {0: '          ', 1: '          ', 2: '          ', 3: '          ', 4: ' (35,913) ', 5: ' 34,973   ', 6: '          '}}", "table_summary": "The table presents financial data related to balances, payments, adjustments, and expenses for International Welding and The Harris Products Group, along with consolidated figures for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

The approximate fair value of the Company\u2019s long-term debt, including current maturities, was based on a valuation model using Level 2 observable inputs using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment. The carrying value of this debt at such dates was $1,250,555 and $1,102,771, respectively. Since judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange. # Senior Unsecured Notes On June 20, 2024, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cNPA\u201d) pursuant to which it agreed to issue new senior unsecured notes (\u201c2024 Notes\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $550,000, at par. Pursuant to the NPA, the Company issued one series of the 2024 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000 on June 20, 2024, and two series of the 2024 Notes each in the aggregate principal amount of $75,000 on August 22, 2024. On April 1, 2015 and October 20, 2016, the Company entered into separate Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") through a private placement. The 2015 and 2016 Notes each have an aggregate principal amount of $350,000. The Company\u2019s total weighted average effective interest rate and remaining weighted average tenure of the senior unsecured notes is 4.1%, including the impact from terminated swap agreements as discussed in Note 14, and 8.9 years, respectively. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is paid semi-annually. The senior unsecured notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants relating to the senior unsecured notes. # Term Loan On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which was borrowed in full. On June 20, 2024, the Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the initial series of 2024 Notes to repay the Term Loan in full. In June 2024, the Company terminated the interest rate swaps that were associated with the Term Loan and realized a gain of $2,428, which is recorded in Other income. # Revolving Credit Agreements On June 20, 2024, the Company terminated its existing $500,000 revolving credit facility and entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility, which may be increased, subject to certain conditions including the consent of its lenders, by an additional amount up to $300,000. The revolving credit facility matures on June 20, 2029. The revolving credit facility will initially bear interest on outstanding borrowings at a per annum rate equal to SOFR plus 1.10% and could fluctuate based on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio at a spread ranging from SOFR plus 1.10% to SOFR plus 1.60%. The financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.5x EBITDA and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5x EBITDA. The revolving credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, as well as customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type (subject to negotiated baskets and exceptions), including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Company has other lines of credit and debt agreements totaling $45,608. As of December 31, 2024 the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had outstanding debt under short-term lines of credit of $10,520.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e4c1617-5920-44e8-ac0d-cefb2412369d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e4c1617-5920-44e8-ac0d-cefb2412369d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e0c781d-cb0c-407f-9da2-7bdf50e94e42", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c6254e89bd382666a7ff2682ff2280a58a038ea0daf2ada866748259b5b6a79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f577493c-a087-4d30-a2c2-e0e6ec91e6b9", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Number of Options\nType: integer\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Weighted Average Exercise Price\nType: currency\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "dc239c16cd886ccf117500a6bd95ee8955a618c62a30c80fa8d266d5f687f8b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# Other Maturities of long-term debt, including payments for amounts due banks, for the five years succeeding December 31, 2024 are $110,524 in 2025, $5 in 2026, $0 in 2027, $100,000 in 2028, $75,000 in 2029 and $975,000 thereafter.

rate assumptions, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plans\u2019 portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets. The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance. The rate of compensation increase is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. # Pension Plans\u2019 Assets The primary objective of the pension plans\u2019 investment policy is to ensure sufficient assets are available to provide benefit obligations when such obligations mature. Investment management practices must comply with ERISA or any other applicable regulations and rulings. The overall investment strategy for the defined benefit pension plans\u2019 assets is to achieve a rate of return over a normal business cycle relative to an acceptable level of risk that is consistent with the long-term objectives of the portfolio. Excluding the RAP plan assets, the target allocation for plan assets is 10% to 15% equity securities and 85% to 90% debt and other securities.

In October 2016, the Company announced a plan redesign of The Lincoln Electric Company Employee Savings Plan (\u201cSavings Plan\u201d) that was effective January 1, 2017. The Savings Plan provides that eligible employees receive up to 6% of employees\u2019 annual compensation through Company matching contributions of 100% of the first 3% of employee compensation contributed to the plan, and automatic Company contributions equal to 3% of annual compensation. In addition, certain employees affected by the RAP freeze in 2016 are also eligible to receive employer contributions equal to 6% of annual compensation for a minimum period of five years or to the end of the year in which they complete thirty years of service. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company created The Lincoln Electric Company Restoration Plan (\u201cRestoration Plan\u201d). The Restoration Plan is a domestic unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing certain employees the ability to fully participate in standard employee retirement offerings, which are limited by IRS regulations on covered compensation.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more-likely-than-not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. At December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $35,284 was recorded against certain deferred tax assets based on this assessment. The Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company\u2019s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes. The Company determined it will repatriate earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to foreign withholding taxes. The Company has estimated the associated tax to be $76. The Company considers remaining earnings and outside basis in all other non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and has not recorded any deferred taxes as such estimate is not practicable. # Unrecognized Tax Benefits Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are classified as Other liabilities unless expected to be paid in one year. Additionally, to the extent a position would not result in a cash tax liability, those amounts are generally recorded to Deferred income taxes to offset tax attributes.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. The Company is currently subject to various state audits and non-U.S. income tax audits. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until after the close of an audit. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including management\u2019s judgment in the interpretation of applicable tax law, regulation or tax ruling, the progress of tax audits and closing of statutes of limitations. Based on information currently available, management believes that additional audit activity could be completed and/or statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits. It is reasonably possible there could be a further reduction of $2,023 in prior years\u2019 unrecognized tax benefits in 2025. # NOTE 14 \u2013 DERIVATIVES The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices arising in the normal course of business. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are assessed as to their effectiveness, when applicable. Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024. The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments. Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions. None of the concentrations of risk with any individual counterparty was considered significant at December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. # Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these short-term contracts was $96,444 and $84,148 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims. Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves. Based on the Company\u2019s historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company\u2019s current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. # NOTE 19 \u2013 SUPPLIER FINANCING PROGRAM The Company\u2019s suppliers, at the supplier\u2019s sole discretion, are able to factor receivables due from the Company to a financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution without affecting the Company\u2019s balance sheet classification of the corresponding payable. The Company pays the financial institution the stated amount of the confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices. Invoices with suppliers have terms between 120 and 180 days. The Company does not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangement and has no involvement in establishing the terms or conditions of the arrangement between its suppliers and the financial institution. The amounts due to the financial institution for suppliers that participate in the supplier financing program are included in Trade accounts payable on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Trade accounts payable included $29,164 and $29,111, respectively, payable to suppliers that have elected to participate in the supplier financing program.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2851, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57d02bfd-b62c-49a3-b705-9229831e82af": {"__data__": {"id_": "57d02bfd-b62c-49a3-b705-9229831e82af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca51b1ab-51c8-4252-8a23-df304f5cc09c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91cc6cb8619dc9bfceb369d7bd4bf7cf77689eb4f774c29e2f87531de277a26c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77c0ed06-9dc3-4b98-8bd5-3a1bc090507e", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Description\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Balance at Beginning Of period\nType: currency\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses\nType: currency\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: (Credited) Charged to Other Accounts (1)\nType: currency\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Deductions (2)\nType: currency\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Balance at End of Period\nType: currency\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "1dda0ef84d01b7180c5ed7859e486ebca8f998effe09a119fb7f4c4683c237a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\\# SCHEDULE II \u2013 VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS # LINCOLN ELECTRIC HOLDINGS, INC. # (In thousands)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 101, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9603d743-d3b4-4fe0-aa48-efce24a1be3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9603d743-d3b4-4fe0-aa48-efce24a1be3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca51b1ab-51c8-4252-8a23-df304f5cc09c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91cc6cb8619dc9bfceb369d7bd4bf7cf77689eb4f774c29e2f87531de277a26c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "295cca95-ca95-42a6-a914-d8bef975d102", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' Description                             ': {0: ' Allowance for doubtful accounts:        ', 1: ' Year Ended December 31, 2024            ', 2: ' Year Ended December 31, 2023            ', 3: ' Deferred tax asset valuation allowance: ', 4: ' Year Ended December 31, 2024            ', 5: ' Year Ended December 31, 2023            '}, ' Balance at Beginning Of period ': {0: ' $ 11,464                       ', 1: ' $ 12,556                       ', 2: ' $ 11,105                       ', 3: ' $ 36,876                       ', 4: ' $ 44,627                       ', 5: ' $ 55,619                       '}, ' Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses ': {0: ' $ 4,371                                 ', 1: ' $ 1,195                                 ', 2: ' $ 1,778                                 ', 3: ' $ 3,010                                 ', 4: ' $ 4,570                                 ', 5: ' $ 2,262                                 '}, ' (Credited) Charged to Other Accounts (1) ': {0: '                                          ', 1: '                                          ', 2: ' $ 598                                    ', 3: '                                          ', 4: '                                          ', 5: '                                          '}, ' Deductions (2) ': {0: ' $ 1,104        ', 1: ' $ 2,193        ', 2: ' $ 925          ', 3: ' $ 1,070        ', 4: ' $ 11,715       ', 5: ' $ 8,057        '}, ' Balance at End of Period ': {0: ' $ 12,674                 ', 1: ' $ 11,464                 ', 2: ' $ 12,556                 ', 3: ' $ 35,284                 ', 4: ' $ 36,876                 ', 5: ' $ 44,627                 '}}", "table_summary": "The table provides a detailed breakdown of changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred tax asset valuation over specific periods.

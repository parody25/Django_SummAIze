- The Cash Flow Statement (showing cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities)
- The Statement of Changes in Equity (showing movement in share capital, retained earnings, and reserves)

Focus only on the actual tabular or narrative financial data and headings related to these statements, not introductory or summary text.

More than 57% of our customers in Dubai are residents\u2014and international markets continued to be strong.\n\nA new, post-pandemic world is upon us, where the way we live, work, and play has been permanently altered. Adapting to such changes calls for reimagining spaces with flexibility and wellness at their core. Our record sales of residences, high occupancy at our offices, hotels and malls, and a robust pipeline of highly anticipated projects testify to the attractiveness of our properties to our customers and investors alike, at home and abroad.\n\nIt also reflects their confidence in Dubai\u2019s future. Emerging quickly from the pandemic, Dubai has strengthened its credentials as a world-class city that offers safety, high quality of life and good governance, prompting people from across the world to align their aspirations with the nation\u2019s ambitions. Thanks to the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and progressive government policies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is looking forward to an exciting tomorrow.\n\n 2023: The year of sustainability\n\nThe UAE has undertaken extensive efforts in recent years towards driving sustainability in the country under the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, and in alignment with the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, UAE President, has recently declared 2023 as the year of sustainability, to promote innovation so that relevant and need-focused solutions can be found that help to bridge the transition between the conventional and a more sustainability-oriented society. As one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing cities, Dubai has the responsibility to champion sustainability, which is one of the priorities for 2023 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai.\n\nThe Dubai government\u2019s \u2018Green Economy for Sustainable Development\u2019, announced in 2012, sets the direction for establishing the country as a model for the new green economy, strengthening competitiveness and preserving the environment for future generations. UAE will be hosting the COP28 conference in late 2023, and this will mark the coming together of a host of initiatives to achieve the UAE\u2019s Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative.\n\n Delivering strong performance\n\nThe efforts made by the government to diversify the UAE economy and enable Dubai to be a business-friendly city through progressive and pragmatic legislation make it easier for us to stretch the boundaries of possibilities and welcome enterprise to our shores. The UAE economy grew by 6.5% in 2022 thanks to a strong comeback in travel and tourism, business, retail, construction, and activities related to the Expo 2020 Dubai. Oil production also went up.\n\nIt was also an excellent year for the real estate market in the UAE, with sales and income reaching multi-year highs in many areas. A stable cost environment meant easing supply-side pressures, leading to faster execution and benefiting from both the macro tailwinds and strong demand for real estate, and reaping the fruits of the strategic measures put in place during the pandemic. We achieved property sales of AED 35.1 Bn.\n\n Building future-ready Emaar\n\nEmaar, as the largest integrated developer in the region and one of the largest globally, has been completely aligned with the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan which maps out a comprehensive plan for a sustainable urban development in Dubai. It focuses on enhancing people\u2019s happiness and quality of life and reinforcing Dubai as a global destination for citizens, residents and visitors over the next 20 years. With an aim to make UAE one of the world\u2019s best countries with sustainability conundrum, we have taken specific measures, such as eradicating single-use plastics and moving to biodegradable items in our hospitality chains. From our restaurants to our guest rooms and conference venues, all have been rendered plastic-free, leading to a substantial reduction in waste to landfills.\n\n Reinforcing commitment\n\nWe remain committed to bringing luxury living to the world\u2014defining high standards, and delighting customers with more than they desire. Our strategy of masterplan-led development and the unique mix of comfort, convenience, glamour, and entertainment that we offer is a blueprint for our international markets too. Across the regions where we are extending our presence, we are developing iconic properties that empower people to shop, eat, work, play and live in new ways. By blending great locations, excellent design, innovative technology and imaginative thinking, we hope to bring luxury living to more and more people.\n\n Note of gratitude\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners for your unwavering support. We are also thankful to our Board of Directors for their invaluable guidance and wise counsel.\n\nJamal Bin Theniyah\n\nChairman\n\nEMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5209, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51613ff9-029d-453c-9703-c9fdabc63928": {"__data__": {"id_": "51613ff9-029d-453c-9703-c9fdabc63928", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ce41e77-7f81-45e2-99d9-d47d5158c66b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75e46f3d1a305840062ab9b85edb3c01f3472cb8827ccc509d6653620b9f03d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9792e01-43da-4b26-87cf-9bb3e1a4584e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af8dd7f26e70997d623937c6df490cdb471d26bd88ed6f316e9fd4d2abbbf2c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\n ONWARD TO NEWER HORIZONS\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nIf the previous two years were an indication of how resilient and well established our organisation is, then this year is all about affirmation and fresh starts. Now that the challenges of the pandemic are firmly behind us, we are witnessing the financial fruits of a robust recovery. There is widespread assurance and a sense of urgency to get things done. As in the years of the pandemic, our Rulers and the Dubai Government have been our guiding light, stimulating economic vitality through investment-friendly schemes, the most recent being the Golden Visa programme. With Dubai\u2019s commercial, trade, logistics, and tourism activities swiftly resuming to normalcy and its ambitious \u2018D33\u2019 agenda, the city\u2019s growth story remains as alluring and enduring as ever.\n\n Strong financial performance\n\nOur record performance this year bears out Dubai\u2019s continuing appeal to the millions who visit our city and professionals who choose to stay and build their lives here. Emaar continues to be the first choice among customers, which reflects in the Company\u2019s performance. This year, our newly launched projects have done exceedingly well with 98% of the units launched already sold, aggregating a Year-on-Year (YoY) increase in sales of 12%. Consolidating the high-growth trend, this year Emaar Properties PJSC has reported group property sales of AED 35.1 Bn, revenues of AED 24.9 Bn and a net profit attributable to owners of AED 6.8 Bn. Recurring revenue operations continued to stay robust, comprising 36% of total revenues, while recurring EBITDA contribution has reached 53% of total EBITDA. Our property sales backlog of AED 53.2 Bn signals a very healthy financial position and secures our near-term prospects.\n\n Significant transactions and strategic development\n\nIn the post-pandemic phase, Dubai has witnessed high international traveller footfalls and received the highest international tourist spending at US$ 29.4 Bn. This resurgence in the tourism sector is reflected in our hospitality revenues, which have grown by 25% YoY, while our Malls business recorded 8% YoY growth. Emaar\u2019s transformational growth agenda has advanced with scale and speed over the last year, owing to a number of significant transactions and strategic development projects that have laid the groundwork for the company\u2019s accelerated execution of the said agenda, which includes substantial geographic and sector expansion across the platform.\n\n Emaar Development\n\nOur build-to-sell property development business achieved property sales at AED 30.7 Bn, marking an increase of 12% compared to 2021. Led by the resilience of the Dubai property market, we delivered 6,100 units in 2022 and ~9,000 units are in pipeline for delivery in 2023. Net profit attributable to owners of Emaar Development rose 17% to touch AED 3.8 Bn. Open spaces and waterfront locations remain the most preferred, with apartment sales accounting for the lion\u2019s share.\n\n Emaar Mall Management\n\nRevenues from our Malls business saw a healthy increase of 8% on the back of Dubai emerging as a leading tourism destination. This was reflected in tenant sales growing by 40% vis-\u00e0-vis pre-pandemic levels. Even our latest entrant Dubai Hills Mall, a large regional shopping format launched in February 2022, achieved 91% occupancy within a mere span of 10 months from its launch. Our mixed retail format portfolio enables us to strategically position super regional, regional, specialty and community-integrated retail to meet a wide range of shopping and consumption needs. We have one of the industry\u2019s most diverse mix of brands and high-street retail with various product categories in the offering mix. This strategy has proved very effective and complements our mixed-use development-based business model.\n\n Emaar International\n\nInternational markets continue to form a critical part of our growth strategy. Our masterplan-led, marquee project-centred development forms the foundation of our entry into high-potential markets. We will utilise our landbank of 1.3 Bn sq ft and look at mutually beneficial JVs and JDAs for large projects. We are also eager to take our recurring revenue businesses of malls, retail and hospitality to more countries, as their unique brand and service values will help strengthen Emaar\u2019s value proposition.

The charter for the future is to drive growth responsibly and sustainably. For instance, in our Arabian Ranches and Emirates Living properties, innovative technology like ultrasonic algae control devices have been introduced to reduce chemical usage for arresting algae growth. We have already put in place plans and strategies for reducing operational and embodied carbon. Our drive towards more sustainable operations aligns with Dubai\u2019s Green Vision, the UAE\u2019s external commitments, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).\n\n Governance\n\nWe remain committed to running our organisation in a transparent and accountable way. Accordingly, our Board has approved a new dividend policy that proposes an increasing share of dividends linked to our performance and will make our stakeholders true partners in our success.\n\n Financial Performance\n\nPoised for accelerated growth, the financial year we have just closed has been exceptional in many ways. We have seen tremendous growth in all our segments, with manifold increase in tourist traffic and a strong trade and commerce resurgence. These trends highlight Dubai\u2019s prominence as a growth magnet within the MENA, Asia and other regions.

It achieved record revenues of AED 3.4 Bn and grew over 57% in 2022, compared to the previous year.\n\nThe hospitality business displayed a robust post-pandemic recovery, which was visible across the UAE economy. We achieved strong ADRs and average occupancy levels of 69% in the UAE during the year. ADR growth and cost control countermeasures helped our hospitality business achieve a record EBITDA margin of 50% in 2022 which is significantly higher compared to the pre-pandemic period. Currently, we have 37 hotels (including JVs) with over 8,100 keys and a healthy pipeline of 29 hotels under development, of which more than 2/3 are under management contracts. In 2022, we achieved the historic milestone of reaching 60 hotel projects in our portfolio (including both in-operation and under-development hotels).\n\n Key numbers", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1020, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cb67e50-061f-44e7-85e8-254dc573f05f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cb67e50-061f-44e7-85e8-254dc573f05f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3900efc0-8d6c-41b8-b002-f8c82b254a95", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2460417808b11f61db07a434718dfeaa8b0de07b3e0eea2ad730d94a008522ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1b2f027-df78-41a2-90e6-ac6773a9369a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Contribution to group revenue': {0: 'Average occupancy rate in the UAE', 1: 'Hotel keys', 2: 'Branded apartments', 3: 'Total keys across hospitality portfolio', 4: 'Commercial leasing space in Dubai'}, '13%': {0: '69%', 1: '37', 2: '362', 3: 'Over 8,100', 4: '2.4 Mn sq ft'}}", "table_summary": "The table provides key metrics related to a hospitality and commercial leasing portfolio, including revenue contribution, occupancy rates, and property details.,\nwith the following columns:\n- Contribution to group revenue: None\n- Average occupancy rate in the UAE: None\n- Hotel keys: None\n- Branded apartments: None\n- Total keys across hospitality portfolio: None\n- Commercial leasing space in Dubai: None\n"}, "hash": "30426e13df5203876b2b8f3b1dd0b6a44bc48b510e4e5e33bfbae034c85ea6cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c08f1e31-5b9f-4d78-8874-21fd7465ebe0", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Year\nType: Year\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Revenues -

Water used at the aquarium exhibits is usually discarded periodically to maintain the cleanliness and health of aquatic animals. In this initiative wastewater is being recycled using a mobile backwash rec and reused in the aquarium. This has helped in reducing environmental impact, also eliminating the need to transport water, and avoiding the need for handling and disposal of quantities of wastewater. Over 80% of used water is being recycled and reused in the aquariums and the project has forecasted ROI of 1.60 years.\n\n Water management\n\nEfficient water management is a priority for Emaar as our properties use more than 802 Mn gallons of water each year. We carefully monitor water usage and costs. The measures include sub-metering to limit use and leak detection. Sub-metering allows tenants to see their water usage, which helps them save.\n\n Water conservation measures\n\nWater conservation decreases the diversion of freshwater from the ecosystem, and saves the energy required for its extraction, treatment and transportation. Several measures are underway including the use of efficient fixtures, smart landscaping, improved irrigation processes, and water-efficient cleaning equipment.\n\n Smart irrigation for landscaping\n\nSmart irrigation technology uses weather data or soil moisture data to determine the irrigation need of plants and avoids unnecessary watering. Further, treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) water from the Dubai Municipality is being used for landscaping purposes.

A lot of high technology goes into maintaining these ambient temperatures. Centralised cooling plants produce chilled water which acts as a heat reducer and is distributed to consumers through a closed piping circuit, or reticulation system. This centralised production and distribution of cooling energy is called District Cooling (DC). Modern, more environment-friendly DC standards prefer using deep seawater as a coolant as it is colder than surface water and can be easily released into the sea after use. Accordingly freshwater use is completely avoided.\n\nEmaar\u2019s properties across Dubai and UAE extensively use district cooling. We own and run Emaar District Cooling (EDC), as a limited liability company providing innovative cooling solutions across key projects in the UAE and Bahrain. Headquartered in Dubai, EDC owns/manages five cooling plants with a combined capacity of 114,800 MT of refrigeration as on 2022, serving both in-house projects and external ones. EDC\u2019s services cover design, construction, commissioning, operation, management and maintenance of complete end-to-end DC plants (DCPs).\n\n Sustainable district cooling\n\nWe provide high-quality cooling using sustainable, energy-efficient engineering solutions. Our district cooling arm, Emaar District Cooling (EDC) focuses on energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and sustainable equipment procurement. EDC works with the objective of creating a sustainable energy landscape in the UAE and reducing carbon emissions. It is the region\u2019s leading district cooling provider in terms of energy efficiency achievement.\n\n The innovative approach taken by EDC includes:\n\n- The utilisation of seawater as a coolant in the Emaar Beachfront district cooling plant. This substantially decreases our water consumption carbon footprint.\n- Installation of thermal storage in respective District Cooling Plants to optimise energy and water consumption rates.\n- Construction of a Treated Sewage Effluent Reverse Osmosis (TSE RO) plant in lieu of individual RO plants in Downtown District Cooling scheme.\n- Employing sophisticated water treatment technologies to monitor, control, and minimise corrosion, scaling and bio-fouling in chilled water systems, and to reduce the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease-causing bacteria.\n\nThe high summer temperatures increase the likelihood of such bacteria occurring, and EDC takes a proactive approach through 24x7 automated chemical treatment system to ensure the safety and health of our users.\n\n For DCPs, efficiency and reliability are the most critical parameters.\n\nScale economies, that emerge from serving many customers, help to keep down costs. But remaining operationally efficient is as important as operations are typically highly energy-intensive. Any improvement in efficiencies thus results in huge savings in running costs. EDC has been a consistent high performer on both these criteria and has received numerous awards, the most recent being District Cooling Utility Provider award, 2022, at CPI\u2019s Climate Control Awards.\n\n Total District Cooling Energy Consumption in the UAE", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3445, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be98b85e-cf31-4cf5-9781-0ac6305fbb50": {"__data__": {"id_": "be98b85e-cf31-4cf5-9781-0ac6305fbb50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f2a2fe7-9d82-4626-a8a8-91634b777214", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8ba1f404bde13406f258bda95de2ebbd89c565cbd0f2daae6cfe5fd600c7e49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "485f2a48-5298-411a-b5af-bf31d16c8df7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'0': {0: '18,932', 1: '1,452,839'}, '87,800 MTCO': {0: 'gasoline powered cars driven over one year', 1: ' '}, 'eq savings in 2022': {0: 'Equals carbon sequestered by saplings over a decade', 1: ' '}}", "table_summary": "The table provides data on carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) savings in 2022, comparing it to the impact of gasoline-powered cars driven over one year and the carbon sequestration by saplings over a decade.,\nwith the following columns:\n- 0: None\n- 87,800 MTCO: None\n- eq savings in 2022: None\n"}, "hash": "e22af0e282846187333d0afeae982868cf3510374b5108b7cfe89763e0fc8311", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Beachfront DCP is housed in the basement of a residential tower and does not require a separate plot, thus saving space.

The villa communities shortlisted 59 entrants per category based on garden sizes of small, medium and large. Community management chose winners from the finalists and their interviews were featured in the community bulletins.\n\nHome Garden Competitions will be expanded to apartments in the coming years to promote terrace gardening and the cultivation of homegrown foods.\n\n Electric vehicle charging units\n\nEmaar Properties is committed to the UAE\u2019s vision of becoming a global leader in green real estate and infrastructure development.

All our upcoming projects will have EV charging facilities.\n\n Kill the Bill challenge\n\nEmaar Communities\u2019 Kill the Bill Challenge encouraged power and water conservation amongst residents. The project was launched via email blasts and posters, and during the course of the project there was a significant reduction in utility bills of residential units. The one-year period between August 2021 till August 2022 was reviewed as a part of this challenge, and aspects like unit occupancy, change in the number of occupants, and measures taken to reduce usage were considered while evaluating the usage patterns. Top contestants cut utility bills by 54.6%.\n\n Business through local partners\n\nAs we progress towards integrating our ESG priorities within our supply chain, we are increasing local procurements, and in the process, cutting back on GHG emissions and also strengthening the local economy.

The project supports the Egyptian State\u2019s strategy to improve village life and aims at providing free housing to marginalised communities.\n\nEmaar Misr has invested EGP 140 Mn for the first and second phases of this project. Under this project, for each unit that Emaar builds in Egypt, it will aim to provide a housing unit to an underprivileged family. Emaar Misr has completed delivery of the first phase and is currently in the second phase, wherein 431 housing units delivered in Luxor and Sharqiya, two orphanages at Beni Suef and Assiut are to be renovated, and sustainable generating projects will be developed in identified governorates. The houses throughout the project were built using sustainable materials.\n\nEmaar Misr has collaborated with the Tahya Misr Fund to launch Tahya Misr\u2014a social and youth services complex in Sidi Abdel Rahman in the Matrouh governorate. The complex, launched in September 2022, has two fully operational schools, a state-of-the-art medical complex, a sports hub, workshops for Matrouh\u2019s famous traditional handcrafts, and facilities for providing various governmental, social and retail services the village residents need.

As per the IMF, oil prices are projected to fall by about 16% in 2023, while non-fuel commodity prices are expected to decline by 6.3%. Increased activity in China may also ease supply chain pressures and keep commodity prices lower.

The UAE\u2019s fiscal position and ease of doing business are expected to dampen the impact of global macroeconomic conditions. The Government\u2019s strategic measures, including the relaxation of foreign ownership laws and visa reforms, helped the growth momentum continue. The UAE\u2019s economy benefits from solid oil revenues in Abu Dhabi and from the dynamism of a diversified economy in Dubai, notably in tourism, real estate, and transportation sectors. The Middle East region as a whole is more integrated than it has been for years both socially and economically, as seen during the FIFA World Cup, and 2023 is likely to bring significant numbers of youth from other Arab and non-Arab countries. It is also developing its domestic capital market to support growth.\n\n UAE Economy\n\nThe UAE continues to maintain its status as one of the most competitive and highly advanced economies in the world, leveraging innovative strategies to boost economic growth and diversification. The country\u2019s continued economic growth and progress across major economic development indicators showcase the stability of the UAE\u2019s financial ecosystem and the resilience of the national economy.\n\nOne noteworthy highlight was Dubai\u2019s continued smooth post-pandemic recovery, as evidenced by 6% Q3 2022 GDP growth. Looking ahead, Dubai is projected to play an increasingly significant role in the UAE\u2019s growth due to the recent unveiling of the Dubai government\u2019s AED 32 trillion (US$ 8.7 trillion) economic plan. The UAE economy grew 7.6% in 2022 on the back of easing of COVID restrictions leading to robust tourism, momentum from Expo 2020 Dubai, strong recovery in construction industries, as well as higher oil production. Additionally, global uncertainty led to larger financial inflows, contributing to rapid real estate price growth in some segments. Trade crossed AED 2 trillion and re-exports surpassed AED 600 Bn for the first time ever.\n\n Economic Indicators", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2159, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b5c8801-6efd-4857-89ec-b8973bd9718d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b5c8801-6efd-4857-89ec-b8973bd9718d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b4cc8de7-6892-420c-aa0d-2f7c84c40a08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b045683662c087aa43834b534151b784b46c1766bf4a491919cf85127bb9761", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71119a04-944e-4b4c-870b-6d691c989c09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Year': {0: 'GDP Growth % YoY', 1: 'GDP Growth % YoY', 2: 'Q1', 3: 'Q2', 4: 'Q3', 5: 'Q4'}, '2019': {0: '2.6', 1: '(2.9)', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' '}, '2020': {0: '2.6', 1: '(4.5)', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' '}, '2021': {0: '2.3', 1: '(12.4)', 2: ' ', 3: '(18.3)', 4: ' ', 5: ' '}, '2022': {0: '3.3', 1: '(13.5)', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: '6.0', 5: ' '}}", "table_summary": "The table presents the year-over-year GDP growth percentages for the years 2019 to 2022, with specific quarterly data for certain years.,\nwith the following columns:\n- Year: None\n- 2019: None\n- 2020: None\n- 2021: None\n- 2022: None\n"}, "hash": "30f12c0a51f80b1b1dd73f801420f10d146307e83ed2ad9e81ef1b845a47f400", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The UAE is projected to be the fastest growing country in the Arabian Gulf in 2023 with a real GDP growth rate of 4.2% with moderating inflation and non-oil sector delivering healthy growth.\n\nSource: Haver Analytics, Dubai Statistics Center.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict provided an additional challenge to the economy, with Egypt being a net commodity importer, resulting in higher domestic prices and budgetary pressures. Despite this, Egypt\u2019s GDP is projected to remain steady at 4.5% in FY 2023.\n\nEgypt\u2019s strategic monetary tightening, including raising interest rates to 16.2%, has helped to reduce inflation to 24.4% in 2022. Furthermore, the government has provided LE130 Bn in social mitigation packages to protect vulnerable populations from rising prices. The healthy government expenditure to GDP ratio stood at 23.1% in FY 2022 demonstrates the government\u2019s ongoing dedication to addressing the current situation.\n\n Retail Market\n\nThe retail market is anticipated to grow over the next few years with rising support from tourism and increasing household consumption. The retail property sector was hit hard by the pandemic and the increase in online shopping was thought to keep the sector subdued. On the positive side, the segment showed signs of resilience since the second half of 2021 and rents have stabilised.

Given the greater competition, malls are introducing more experiential retail concepts and are seeking to have a greater variety of outlets for visitors to their properties.\n\n Egyptian Real Estate Sector\n\nReal estate is one of the hottest sectors to invest in Egypt. To improve living standards and appeal to investors, the Egyptian government has invested approximately US$ 400 Bn in infrastructure. It is now looking to increase the size of the private sector from 30% to 65% by 2025 in order to increase investments.

It contributes about 6-7% to the Indian GDP and is expected to contribute about 13% by 2025. Despite pandemic exigencies, the sector has continued to show resilience and steady growth in 2022. Covid has helped in bringing about a paradigm shift in how customers view residential properties and has reinforced the importance of home ownership.\n\nGovernment policy initiatives like Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) are expected to ramp up demand in residential and commercial real estate. Increasing NRI and FDI investments are also helping boost the office space segment.

Led by new project launches, Emaar Development has recorded property sales of AED 30.7 Bn (US$ 8.4 Bn) in 2022. Property sales backlog of Emaar Development reached to AED 41.3 Bn (US$ 11.2 Bn), which will be recognised as revenue in the coming years.\n\n Gross Profit\n\nEmaar Development has achieved gross profit of AED 5.2 Bn (US$ 1.4 Bn) supported by improved margins due to change in revenue mix, increase in pricing and control over cost.

The conditions precedent (CPs) for the aforesaid transaction were satisfied on 8 December 2022 and DCH is consolidated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as at 31 December 2022.\n\nAccounting for acquisition has involved significant judgment in order to:\n\n- determine whether the acquisition constitutes a business or is in the nature of an asset acquisition;\n- identify and measure the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and\n- allocate the purchase consideration;\n\nAccordingly, due to the factors noted above and that the transaction represents a material acquisition for the Group, this is considered as a key audit matter.\n\n How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\n- Obtained and reviewed the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d) to obtain an understanding of terms of the transaction, appropriate approvals and authorization and key conditions mentioned therein;\n- Inspected minutes of meetings of Investment Committee, the Board of Directors and Shareholders to ensure appropriate approvals, including regulatory approvals of the transaction;\n- Inspected the report by a management appointed external valuer on determination of value of assets in DCH;\n- We have evaluated the qualifications and competence of the external valuer and read the terms of engagement of the valuers with the Group to determine whether there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or limited the scope of their work;\n- Obtained and assessed management conclusion on accounting for acquisition of DCH and evaluated the conclusion that the transaction is an asset acquisition as the definition of business is not met against the principles of IFRS 3 Business Combinations;\n- Assessed appropriateness of allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities of DCH, based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition;\n- We involved our real estate valuation specialist, who on a sample basis, reviewed valuation methodologies used in the valuation of non-financial assets acquired and challenged assumptions for key estimates of sales price, cost to complete, market rent, future rental income, operating costs, occupancy rate, discount rates, capitalization and terminal yield rates used in the valuation by comparing them against historical rates and available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors;\n- We have assessed the adequacy of the disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Integrated Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors\u2019 report thereon. We obtained Directors\u2019 Report prior to the date of our auditors\u2019 report, and we expect to obtain the remaining sections of the Integrated Report after the date of the auditors\u2019 report.\n\n Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Standards, and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 32 of 2021 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirement\n\nFurther, as required by the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 3 of 2021 we report that for the year ended 31 December 2022:\n\n- we have obtained all the information and explanations we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit;\n- the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and comply, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 32 of 2021;\n- the Group has maintained proper books of account;", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5052, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

Control is achieved where all the following criteria are met:\n\n1. the Group has power over an entity (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);\n2. the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and\n3. the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the Company\u2019s returns.\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- The Group\u2019s voting rights and potential voting rights\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\n Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition or incorporation, being the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3233, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65839d9d-960f-423a-a626-ea6b3a8a15c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "65839d9d-960f-423a-a626-ea6b3a8a15c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "610d5c27-860a-409a-88f7-55cfbb659e4f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5220a8313d799cb56e0beeccc4c8c1ddfbf729daa73729425af4f1b48ca34f9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0546020d-6709-4dc5-8684-48c3610611f9", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Subsidiary\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Place of incorporation\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Principal activities\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Percentage of effective interest\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "403a1f291bdf7d0231aad3ce966af8ee85914b8ed93b3cbff71d6a76570657ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "156 Financial statements\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n As at 31 December 2022\n\nReporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.

The Group has assessed that based on the sale and purchase agreements entered into with customers and the provisions of relevant laws and regulations, where contracts are entered into to provide real estate assets to customer, the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and usually has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In these circumstances the Group recognises revenue over time. Where this is not the case, revenue is recognised at a point in time.\n\nThe consolidated income statement reflects the Group\u2019s share of results of its associates and joint ventures. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in the associates and joint ventures. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n Special purpose entities\n\nSpecial purpose entities are entities that are created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective. The financial information of special purpose entities is included in the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements where the substance of the relationship is that the Group controls the special purpose entity and hence, they are accounted for as subsidiaries.\n\n 2.2 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised.\n\n Judgements\n\nThe key judgements and estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group are discussed below:\n\n Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations\n\nThe Group is required to assess each of its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time in order to recognise revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n Transfer of control in contracts with customers\n\nIn cases where the Group determines that performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, revenue is recognised when control over the asset that is the subject of the contract is transferred to the customer. In the case of contracts to sell real estate assets this is generally when the consideration for the unit has been substantially received and there are no impediments in the handing over of the unit to the customer. The title will be transferred to the customer only upon 100% collection, resulting in a low risk of default and loss thereof.\n\n Transfer of real estate assets from property, plant and equipment to development properties\n\nThe Group sells real estate assets in its ordinary course of business. When the real estate assets which were previously classified as property, plant and equipment are identified for sale in the ordinary course of business, then the assets are transferred to development properties at their carrying value at the date of identification. Sale proceeds from such assets are recognised as revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\n Hyperinflation\n\nTurkey became a hyperinflationary economy in 2022. Management have carried out a detailed assessment of the impact of applying IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and noted that there is no impact of applying IAS 29 on its operations in Turkey, as the functional and presentation currency of the component is US Dollars.\n\n Retrospective change in classification of investments\n\nDuring the current period, based on review of contractual terms and arrangement with the other shareholder, management has re-evaluated its assessment on control over an entity, previously classified as a subsidiary and concluded that both the shareholders have joint control over the relevant business activities. Accordingly, it had retrospectively applied the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5266, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65131b49-baf7-431f-a841-9f436a7a4449": {"__data__": {"id_": "65131b49-baf7-431f-a841-9f436a7a4449", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58818af4-e59f-4178-b180-a92755016bd8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75addad33a843c3175add4190051e9cf7f86c698ab7f06f6d6a8519397c35a7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71845e61-93e5-4adb-8817-d52fe33b9214", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: As previously reported\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Adjustments made\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: As restated now\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "57ac278bc9e770884b345c9dcd8a9579b85517bcf0dc0ba49fd9f64f55372d68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Financial Statements\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n As at 31 December 2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 107, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d84aeb04-303e-4724-a6f3-4a6bba497518": {"__data__": {"id_": "d84aeb04-303e-4724-a6f3-4a6bba497518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58818af4-e59f-4178-b180-a92755016bd8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75addad33a843c3175add4190051e9cf7f86c698ab7f06f6d6a8519397c35a7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63020692-2570-4fa6-bc61-e7d921843e36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' ': {0: 'Assets', 1: 'Bank balances and cash', 2: 'Trade and unbilled receivables', 3: 'Other assets, receivables, deposits and prepayments', 4: 'Development properties', 5: 'Loans to associates and joint ventures', 6: 'Investments in associates and joint ventures', 7: 'Property, plant and equipment', 8: 'Total assets', 9: 'Liabilities', 10: 'Trade and other payables', 11: 'Advances from customers', 12: 'Retentions payable', 13: 'Interest-bearing loans and borrowings', 14: 'Provision for employees\u2019 end-of-service benefits', 15: 'Total liabilities', 16: 'Equity', 17: 'Retained earnings', 18: 'Non-controlling interests'}, 'As previously reported': {0: 'AED\u2019000', 1: '8,657,529', 2: '16,633,888', 3: '14,188,035', 4: '37,740,746', 5: '1,102,196', 6: '5,074,649', 7: '10,625,210', 8: '121,849,528', 9: ' ', 10: '18,572,086', 11: '13,791,499', 12: '1,497,121', 13: '9,416,883', 14: '177,561', 15: '53,654,024', 16: ' ', 17: '33,468,571', 18: '6,502,273'}, 'Adjustments made': {0: ' ', 1: '(118,671)', 2: '(47,832)', 3: '(30,506)', 4: '(51,450)', 5: '5,514', 6: '474,983', 7: '(1,468,013)', 8: '(1,235,975)', 9: ' ', 10: '(50,711)', 11: '(7,993)', 12: '(11,705)', 13: '(708,124)', 14: '(3,865)', 15: '(782,398)', 16: ' ', 17: '21,406', 18: '(474,983)'}, 'As restated now': {0: ' ', 1: '8,538,858', 2: '16,586,056', 3: '14,157,529', 4: '37,689,296', 5: '1,107,710', 6: '5,549,632', 7: '9,157,197', 8: '120,613,553', 9: ' ', 10: '18,521,375', 11: '13,783,506', 12: '1,485,416', 13: '8,708,759', 14: '173,696', 15: '52,871,626', 16: ' ', 17: '33,489,977', 18: '6,027,290'}}", "table_summary": "The table presents a restatement of financial figures, showing adjustments made to assets, liabilities, and equity.

This estimate is determined after considering the expected usage of the asset or physical wear and tear. The management periodically reviews estimated useful lives and the depreciation / amortisation method to ensure that the method and period of depreciation / amortisation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\n Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. The non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and chooses a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\n Measurement of progress when revenue is recognised over time\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the input method to measure the progress of performance obligations where revenue is recognised over time. The Group considers that the use of the input method which requires revenue recognition on the basis of the Group\u2019s efforts to the satisfaction of the performance obligation provides the best reference of revenue actually earned. In applying the input method, the Group estimates the cost to complete the projects in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised.\n\n Cost to complete the projects\n\nThe Group estimates the cost to complete the projects in order to determine the cost attributable to revenue being recognised. These estimates include the cost of providing infrastructure, potential claims by contractors as evaluated by the project consultant and the cost of meeting other contractual obligations to the customers.\n\n Taxes\n\nThe Group is subject to income and capital gains taxes in certain jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required to determine the total provision for current and deferred taxes. The Group established provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provision is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretations may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies.\n\n Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n 2.3 Changes in the Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\nA number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

Determine the transaction price:\n\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\nThe Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements.\n\nRevenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.\n\n Step 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract:\n\nFor a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.\n\n Step 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nThe Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:\n\n1. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group\u2019s performance as the Group performs; or\n2. The Group\u2019s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or\n3. The Group\u2019s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nFor performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n Customer loyalty programme\n\nThe Group operates a loyalty points programme, \u2018U by Emaar\u2019, which allows customers to accumulate points when they spend in any of the Group\u2019s hotel or leisure units. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as they provide a material right to the customer. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative stand-alone selling price and recognised as a contract liability until the points are redeemed.\n\n Lease to buy scheme\n\nSales under the lease to buy scheme are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Rental income during the period of lease is accounted for on a straight-line basis until such time the lessee exercises its option to purchase;\n- When the lessee exercises its option to purchase, a sale is recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policy for sale of property as stated above; and\n- When recognising the sale, revenue is the amount payable by the lessee at the time of exercising the option to acquire the property.\n\n Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nIncome from turnover rent is recognised based on the audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n Income tax\n\nTaxation is provided in accordance with the relevant fiscal regulations of the countries in which the Group operates. Current tax is the expected tax payable/receivable on taxable income/loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted as at the reporting date, and adjustments to the tax receivable/payable in respect of prior years.\n\nIncome tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the consolidated income statement.\n\n Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets or investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group\u2019s other accounting policies.\n\n Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5169, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01f05bfd-9a83-4694-a3f6-254648491395": {"__data__": {"id_": "01f05bfd-9a83-4694-a3f6-254648491395", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cef43a8a-3e3d-4451-99e0-192c88d15d5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6137e1b77e68732a407653cdec2e5bb2dcf026a52e580d254cac7f647353a017", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e46661a-089a-496e-bfda-578a2b0aaed3", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Leasehold improvements\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Sales centres (included in land and buildings)\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Buildings\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Computers and office equipment\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Plant, machinery and heavy equipment\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Motor vehicles\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Furniture and fixtures\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Leisure, entertainment and other assets\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "0036b32dd861ab9772e19205415fbcc2f8916a4f5aa977946facdf4bfd4d9bb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "166 Financial statements\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n As at 31 December 2022\n\n+ in respect of deductible temporary differences that are critical for entities to determine their tax status associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe Group has determined that the Law was not practically operational as at 31 December 2022 and, hence, not enacted or substantively enacted from the perspective of IAS 12 Income Taxes. The Group will continue to monitor the timing of the issuance of these critical Cabinet Decisions to determine its tax status and the applicability of IAS 12 \u2013 Income Taxes.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n Global minimum tax\n\nIn December 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a draft legislative framework, followed by detailed guidance release in March 2022, that is expected to be used by 135 individual jurisdictions, including the UAE, that signed the agreement to amend their local tax laws to align with global minimum tax. Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates are enacted or substantively enacted, the Group may be subject to the top-up tax.

Cost includes:\n\n- Freehold and leasehold rights for land;\n- Amounts paid to contractors for construction; and\n- Borrowing costs, planning and design costs, costs of site preparation, professional fees for legal services.\n\n Inventories\n\nInventories represent consumables and other goods relating to hospitality and retail business segments of the Group. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items. Costs are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on disposal or completion.\n\n Investment in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe consolidated income statement reflects the Group\u2019s share of the results of operations of its associates and joint ventures after tax and non-controlling subsidiaries of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the other comprehensive income or equity of an associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.\n\nThe financial statement of the associates and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\n Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- There is \u2018an economic relationship\u2019 between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n- The effect of credit risk does not \u2018dominate the value changes\u2019 that result from that economic relationship;\n- The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedge item.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3593, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0099c58c-81a3-440b-9b5a-25483b58528a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0099c58c-81a3-440b-9b5a-25483b58528a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aefe853f-ff68-4826-8530-4e9cb3a3d55e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19475b2ff9eef600ed760b1acc435f8bef21fe40353a6964f46386b51bc7c458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14ef5851-1c87-4d22-950f-f3a5a07936eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "acb2fe954e6c3b39492095e0c95726aad02731ca5fc554d404847951389cf6e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "170 Financial statements\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n As at 31 December 2022\n\nFor fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.\n\nIf the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in consolidated income statement.\n\n Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.\n\nThe ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised as other expense and the ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is recognised in other operating income or expenses.\n\nThe Group designates only the spot element of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward element is recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity under cost of hedging reserve.\n\nThe amounts accumulated in consolidated statement of comprehensive income are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.\n\n Financial assets\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date when the purchase or sale of a financial asset is made under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are initially measured at cost, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. Trade and unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\n Debt instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices for assets and offer prices for liabilities, at the close of business on the reporting date. If quoted market prices are not available, reference can also be made to broker or dealer price quotations.\n\nThe fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with credit institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments at the reporting date.\n\n Classification of financial assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\u2019s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group\u2019s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are \u2018solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\u2019 on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nFor the purposes of classifying financial assets, an instrument is an \u2018equity instrument\u2019 if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of \u2018equity\u2019 for the issuer (under IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation) except for certain non-derivative puttable instruments presented as equity by the issuer.

For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\n Derecognition of Financial Assets\n\nA financial asset (or, when applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:\n\n- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n- The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement, and\n- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either:\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\n Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n Trade and Other Payables\n\nLiabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not.\n\n Lease Liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the assessment of whether a purchase option will be exercised, or a change in the amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4297, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29911944-9383-4912-9977-ba7400cbc757": {"__data__": {"id_": "29911944-9383-4912-9977-ba7400cbc757", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8e197405-3193-4bde-a1f9-c299438a422e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af7f39c462f1729e9b671bc15d9b21e6bbdec04be4922f7be7d56c4b6bdb2beb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "174 Financial statements\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n As at 31 December 2022\n\nthe in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating leases, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The average rate applied is 4% to 8%.\n\n Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n Loans and borrowings\n\nTerm loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.\n\n Sukuk\n\nThe sukuk are stated at amortised cost using the effective profit rate method. Profit attributable to the sukuk is calculated by applying the prevailing market profit rate, at the time of issue, for similar sukuk instruments and any difference with the profit distributed is added to the carrying amount of the sukuk. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability component.\n\n End-of-service benefits\n\nThe Group provides end-of-service benefits to its employees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually based upon the employees\u2019 final salary and length of service, subject to the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment.\n\n Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.\n\n Foreign currency translations\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in AED which is the functional currency of the Company.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item.\n\n Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as investment in securities and hedges, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\n Fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- Level 1 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in an active market (that are unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n Segment Information\n\nManagement monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistent with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into three major segments, namely, real estate (develop, sell and manage condominiums, villas, commercial units and plots of land), leasing, retail and related activities (develop, lease and manage malls, retail, commercial and residential spaces) and hospitality (develop, own and/or manage hotels, serviced apartments and leisure). Other segments include businesses that individually do not meet the criteria for a reportable segment as per IFRS 8 Operating Segments. These businesses are property management and utility services and investments in providers of financial services.\n\nRevenue from sources other than property sales, leasing, retail and related activities and hospitality are included in other operating income.\n\n Geographic segments\n\nThe Group is currently operating in a number of countries outside the UAE and is engaged in the development of several projects which have significant impact on the Group results. The domestic segment includes business activities and operations in the UAE and the international segment includes business activities and operations outside the UAE (including export sales).",

The valuation was performed in accordance with standards, adopting the IFRS basis of fair value and using established valuation techniques. The values of properties have been determined through analysis of the income cash flow achievable for the buildings and the projected annual expenditure. Both the contracted rent and estimated rental values have been considered with allowances for void periods, running costs, vacancy rates and other costs.

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only placing balances with international banks and local banks of good repute. Given the profile of its bankers, management does not expect any counterparty to fail in meeting its obligations.\n\n Guarantees\n\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to its subsidiaries and certain associates and joint ventures. For details of guarantees outstanding as at the reporting date refer to note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n Excessive risk of concentration\n\nConcentration arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.\n\nIn order to avoid excessive concentration of risk, the Group\u2019s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed according to the Group\u2019s policies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4677, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6961c84f-1312-40e9-b0d4-40a70f7246b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6961c84f-1312-40e9-b0d4-40a70f7246b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b110e12-359d-49b3-8c41-871bffd7330c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "392563d37d295ff3f6d927e875dbc3dd460cefe2a1cbd53dafaf29ba32c4936b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3865aef1-e1a2-4942-a1c5-4ae15fb0670a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0e1d8b9cc71a6daa6bb399f33dc214635e53502bebe4264bac1ac363b8f864e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Industry             Corporate   Consolidated\n210 FInancIal statements                                                                                                       Introduction  About Emaar  Value CreationOur       Context and          Governance  Financial         211\n                                                                                                                                             Properties   at Emaar  Strategy ESG at Emaar Performance  Report      Statements\n       Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)                                                              Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n       As at 31 December 2022                                                                                                  As at 31 December 2022\n                The maximum exposure to credit risk at the             Exposure to interest rate risk                                   The table below indicates the sensitivity analysis of a change in foreign exchange rates of these curr\n               reporting date is the carrying value of each class ofInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or              impact on other comprehensive income:\n               financial assets.                                       future cash flows of a financial instrument will\n           b)  Market risk                                             fluctuate because of changes in market interest                                                                  2022                        2021\n                                                                       rates.

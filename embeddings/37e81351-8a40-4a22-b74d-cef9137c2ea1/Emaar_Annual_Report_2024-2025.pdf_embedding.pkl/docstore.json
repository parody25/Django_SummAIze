This included taking pivotal steps to evolve and strengthen our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, laying the groundwork for accelerating our transition towards a low carbon real estate industry in the foreseeable future.\n\n ABOUT US\n\nTo realise this vision, we create high-quality, highly desirable residential, commercial, and leisure environments that balance modern lifestyles with luxury, technology, and sustainability. Inspired by the UAE\u2019s \u2018Year of Sustainability\u2019 and guided by transformative frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UAE\u2019s Net Zero 2050 Strategy, our sustainability commitments and driving identify and address climate-related risks and opportunities across our value chain.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nAs we step into this new future of real estate, sustainability is integral to our approach. From environmentally responsible design practices to AI-driven technology for property management and resource optimisation, and strategic initiatives for cultivating thriving, connected, and engaged communities. We focus these pioneering efforts on projects that use smart design to prioritise livability, connectivity, social value and eco-efficiency.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nDuring the year, we created a number of internal working groups and taskforces to drive the implementation of our strategy across the Group. We established an ESG Reporting and Data Capture Working Group to align with frameworks such as the GRI Standards and IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, improving transparency and accuracy in our reporting.\n\n ESG STRATEGY\n\nOur sustainability efforts this year were further reinforced by our sustainability milestones, including Burj Khalifa\u2019s attainment of LEED Platinum certification and the Green Key recognition of eleven of our hotels.

The medium-term reduction target is to reduce building-related emissions by 56%, by 2030. As Dubai\u2019s premier real estate developer, we are determined to play a key role in achieving the UAE\u2019s Net Zero 2050 Strategy. In recognition of the urgency of this issue, we focused upon climate risk and mitigation at our Risk Committee meeting in September 2024. The Risk Committee endorsed the concern that climate change is an emerging risk to our business and sanctioned the development of proactive strategies to mitigate and adapt to these challenges. We also created a comprehensive emissions inventory in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, swiftly followed by the development of a climate change mitigation roadmap.\n\nWith respect to Scope 3, we are working through the various categories of emissions that are contextually important to our business operations and with stakeholders across our value chain to capture emissions data. Our rebased emissions for 2023 for UAE, India and Egypt are 722,462 tCO2e. In 2024, across these three businesses, we emitted 774,698 tCO2e marking a slight increase of 7% during the year. The increase may be attributed to a more comprehensive data set from Emaar Community Management in the UAE, as well as our expanding asset base across all businesses.

These architectural shading elements ultimately reduce the need for cooling within the buildings, driving commensurate decreases in energy consumption and emissions while enhancing aesthetic appeal.\n\nIn addition to energy savings, these features improve visual comfort by diffusing natural light and minimising glare for occupants. This enhances interior lighting quality and reduces the need for artificial illumination, supporting resource-efficient operations.\n\n SOCIAL\n\n GOVERNANCE\n\nThese horizontal elements effectively reduce direct sunlight penetration, minimising solar heat gain and the reliance on artificial cooling systems.

Unfortunately, the incidents involved equipment malfunctions and unauthorised operations.\n\n ABOUT US\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n ESG STRATEGY\n\nKey lessons have emerged from these incidents that reinforce the importance of stringent equipment inspections and maintenance, clear operational procedures, and continuous safety training. In direct response, we have worked with our contractors to implement enhanced site supervision, mandatory pre-operational equipment checks, and improved communication protocols for vehicle operations. Additional measures include stricter third-party oversight, the introduction of designated safety personnel for high-risk activities, and the deployment of visual aids such as barriers and signage to reinforce safe working zones.\n\n Safety Performance\n\nEmaar remains deeply committed to achieving zero harm, holding itself and its partners accountable to the highest safety standards.\n\n Fire Safety:\n\nNo major fire incidents were recorded in 2024. Temporary firefighting systems were installed across all Emaar plots, and regular inspections and audits ensured full compliance with fire safety regulations.\n\n Incident and Observation Management:\n\nFrom 359 inspections conducted in 2024, 2,768 observations were raised and promptly addressed. This proactive management approach contributed to achieving 100% of the year\u2019s strategic safety deliverables.\n\n Fall Protection Measures:\n\nEmaar implemented robust systems to mitigate fall-related risks and further enhance safety measures on our construction sites.\n\n Regulatory Compliance:\n\nFull compliance with regulatory requirements was maintained, with no fines issued by authorities.\n\n H&S Training for Workers\n\nTo embed a culture of safety across our operations, over 15,000 hours of Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) training were delivered in 2024, across our sites. This comprehensive training addressed critical risks, including working at heights, electrical safety, fire controls, excavation protocols, and equipment handling, ensuring that every worker is equipped to operate safely and confidently.\n\n H&S-related job-specific training\n\nprovided to workers across the UAE.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2544, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19dfa6b6-39f3-4ec4-bef2-ec7790fbb826": {"__data__": {"id_": "19dfa6b6-39f3-4ec4-bef2-ec7790fbb826", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b2279c8-90a5-45b2-9a93-4f137bad7210", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b958c83491a900d94103d7bd2f98af7abfb865a4c547bf9fb6e48008296fcdbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n ESG in Action\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n ABOUT US\n\nHealth and Safety at Emaar\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve 2025 Celebrations\n\nEmaar\u2019s Hospitality Group Named \u2018Beat the Heat\u2019 \u2013 Protecting Worker Welfare in Dubai\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nEmaar Properties hosted 900,000 visitors across Downtown Dubai during its New Year\u2019s Eve 2025 celebrations, ensuring health and safety through meticulous planning and collaboration with city authorities.\n\nExtended Dubai Metro operations, 260 shuttle buses, and designated road closures facilitated safe and efficient guest movement.

In 2024, we performed a preliminary analysis on the effects of April\u2019s torrential rains on Emaar. The analysis outlined steps taken to manage the situation and future actions to improve preparedness for similar climate challenges. The analysis was presented to the Risk Committee (comprised of Board members) in September 2024.\n\nAdditionally, our Climate Change and Environment Working Group is actively overseeing the implementation of this and identifying climate-related risks and opportunities. In September 2024, the Risk Committee formally identified climate change as an emerging risk to our business.

Internal Audit and Compliance functions report functionally to the Audit Committee, maintaining an independent oversight, while Risk function report to the Risk Committee with access to the Board and relevant Board Committees reinforcing accountability and regulatory alignment.\n\n c) Audit Committee Oversight on Internal controls\n\nInternal Audit provides independent and objective assurance and advisory services designed to add value and improve the Group\u2019s operations.

2024\n\n ABOUT US\n\nThe Frontiers in Sustainability program, offered through IMD, provided modules over several days for employees, while the Frontiers in Private Equity program at Oxford University offered an intensive multi-day course.\n\nIn 2024, the HR and People & Performance departments at Emaar embarked on a transformative journey, implementing a series of specialised programs and initiatives. This report highlights our innovative approach to talent development and organisational growth.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nGroup-Wide Talent Identification Framework:+ Top Talent (Grade 9+): Employees ready for leadership roles.+ High-Potential Talent (Grades 7-8): Future leaders in need of development.+ Emerging Talent (Grades 4-6): Early-career employees with strong growth potential.\nThis framework provided a structured method for identifying and nurturing successors for critical roles.\n\n Group Wide Critical Position Framework:\n\nThe critical roles identification exercise required leaders to rate all Grade 7+ roles on a 3-point scale, including any critical technical roles below Grade 7. The process involved collaboration with N-1 and N-2, line managers to ensure a role-centric evaluation. A final calibration ensured alignment on a well-justified list, with qualitative rationale provided for each critical role. The exercise was conducted with a selective approach, emphasising roles with the highest impact while maintaining confidentiality.\n\n Training Needs Analysis:\n\nTo build a robust group-level learning strategy, a centralised Training Needs Analysis was implemented for all Compliance and Technical Training. This initiative aimed to align training programs with regulatory requirements, enhance team skills, and maintain a competitive edge across the organisation.\n\n Online Learning Access:\n\nAll staff members have access to various learning platforms:\n\n- Senior staff (Grades 7+): Coursera access for a comprehensive range of courses and certifications from top universities.\n- Intermediate staff (Grades 5&6): LinkedIn Learning access for diverse modules and learning videos.\n- Junior staff (Grades 1-4): EdApp Learning platform for personalised learning queues and extensive quizzes.\n\n Achievements\n\n- + Collaborated with iFAB to deliver specialised training for Grade 8 and above, including the Frontiers in Finance program, with online and in-person sessions at Yale University.\n- + Hosted the H1 2024 Rally to recognise and celebrate employee contributions, dedication, and achievements, with employees across various levels being acknowledged and rewarded for their exceptional work.\n- + Launched the Train the Trainer (TTT) program, which included multiple workshops and successfully certified employees as Master Trainers, capable of delivering product and technical training.\n- + Revamped the downtown learning academy to facilitate the launch of the EHG Orientation Program and any future classroom training sessions.\n- + The mentorship program aimed to enhance professional development by pairing mentors with mentees to boost skills, knowledge, and career growth at Emaar. Mentorship Program 2.0 included success criteria to measure the impact on both mentors and mentees. A total of 88 mentees and 17 mentors participated in the program.\n- + Organised the LeaderShift workshop for mentors and high-potential expats, certified by Maxwell Leadership, with a significant number of participants earning certification.\n- + The CFA Program has been introduced at Emaar Academy as part of the development track to enhance financial skills among UAE Nationals. Out of 50 participants, 11 have successfully advanced to the CFA batch after passing the PRE-CFA assessment. The assessment is scheduled for May 2025, supporting Emaar\u2019s goal of building financial expertise within the organisation.\n- + Participation in Ru\u2019ya Career Fair, the largest UAE national based career fair, where we successfully received over 1380 applicants.\n- + As part of the International Exposure Program, selected UAE Nationals from Emaar Properties will undertake a 12-week assignment at Emaar India and Emaar Egypt. This initiative is designed to bridge key skill gaps by offering participants hands-on experience and valuable insights into the macro-economic environments, cultures, and real estate markets of India and Egypt. The program will also expose them to standardised operational practices, expand their professional networks, and enhance their project management capabilities.

The transfer to statutory reserve from the distributable profit has been suspended as the reserve has reached 50% of the paid-up share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has proposed a cash dividend of 100% of share capital, which is subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.\n\nThe balance of the distributable profit after considering appropriation to general reserve and proposed dividend (subject to approval of the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting) will be transferred to retained earnings. Total equity attributable to owners of the Company as at 31 December 2024 amount to AED 85,428 million prior to proposed dividend.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n Principal Activities\n\nThe principal activities of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2024 were property investment, development and development management, shopping malls and retail, hospitality, property management and utility services and investment in providers of financial services.\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n Our Performance in 2024\n\nEmaar has shown strong commitment to the development of Dubai\u2019s economy and the improvement of our society. Our contributions in all areas have been substantial and effective, driven by steady growth in the real estate market, recovery in travel and tourism, and trust in Emaar\u2019s leading brands. During the year the Group acquired 141 million square feet of development land in prime area in Dubai with a total development value of AED 96 billion. This strategic expansion aims to redefine luxurious living while fostering a greener future within Dubai\u2019s landscape.\n\nIn 2024, Emaar achieved group property sales of approximately AED 70 billion, marking a 72% increase compared to previous year and bolstering Group revenue backlog from property sales over AED 110 billion, including joint ventures.\n\nFurthermore, our diverse recurring revenue portfolio, comprising malls, hospitality, leisure, entertainment, and commercial leasing, witnessed remarkable growth, surpassing AED 9.3 billion in revenue, representing a growth of more than 8% from the previous year (excluding Namshi, sold in February 2023 and one-off revenue adjustment in 2023). Notably, our flagship asset, the Dubai Mall, welcomed a record 111 million visitors, an increase of around 6% compared to the previous year, making the mall the most visited place on Earth for the second consecutive year.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, our strategic brand positioning and robust project pipeline promise sustained growth and success. Our substantial revenue backlog from property sales lays a strong foundation for future growth, reinforced by the robust performance of our recurring revenue businesses and our plans to further expand this segment. We remain committed to unveiling innovative projects and unparalleled offerings across all our business divisions.\n\nWe have long recognised our responsibility to both society and the environment, and over the years, we have taken various initiatives to integrate ESG principles into our operations. In 2024, the Group established a comprehensive sustainability strategy focused on resource use, waste management, water stewardship, and responsible sourcing.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants\u2019 International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the United Arab Emirates, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n Revenue recognition on sale of properties and lease rental income\n\nThe Group recognises revenue on sale of properties in accordance with IFRS 15 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and lease income in accordance with IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d.\n\n+ We have assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies adopted by the Group.\n\n+ Obtained an understanding of the revenue process implemented by the Group.\n\n+ We have performed test of design and implementation of relevant controls.\n\n+ On a sample basis, we have assessed the contracts for sale of properties to identify the performance obligations of the Group under these contracts and assessed whether these performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time based on the criteria specified under IFRS 15.\n\n+ On a sample basis, we have assessed the appropriateness of percentage of completion of the construction of properties by reference to costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total costs, where the performance obligation is satisfied over time.\n\n+ On a sample basis, we have assessed the adequacy of the total estimated cost to complete through the management appointed external cost consultant\u2019s report, supporting agreements, retrospective evaluation of budgets and other relevant information.\n\nWe have also evaluated, on a sample basis, the qualifications and competence of the management appointed cost consultants.\n\nRental income from leased properties is recognised in accordance with the terms of the lease agreed with the tenants on a straight-line basis from the operating lease commencement date over the period of the lease. The lease agreements may include certain clauses relating to (i) lease income computed based on lessee turnover; and (ii) tenant incentives which may affect the amount of rental income recognised during the year.\n\nConsidering the inherent risks around the existence and accuracy, rental income from leased properties warrants additional audit focus.\n\n+ On a sample basis, we tested lease agreements to ensure the existence and accuracy of the revenue recognised during the year and its compliance with IFRS.\n\n+ We assessed the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosure in relation to the requirements of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4766, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a384953-7777-4488-91d1-288cf763abef": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a384953-7777-4488-91d1-288cf763abef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "051b818c-f396-474f-98b2-b65f7896538d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ddd89bf00fb3e440b9266c28088a21673cfdf0833c28b7398b0ff25be745120", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n ABOUT US\n\nThe key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group owns both development properties (including completed projects and those under construction) and investment properties, collectively referred to as \u201cthe properties.\u201d Valuing these properties involves significant judgment, based on various assumptions and prevailing market conditions. These conditions include heightened geopolitical tensions, low economic growth in many major countries, and a \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rate environment, all of which increase the potential for constrained credit markets, negative capital value movements, and continued volatility in some property markets over the short-to-medium term.\n\nDevelopment properties are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nInvestment properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment if any. The Group engages professionally qualified management appointed valuers to assess the value for a substantial portion of its properties. This process of assessment of the value involves significant judgement in estimating the underlying assumptions to be applied.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nConsidering the uncertainty surrounding the net realisable value of the Group\u2019s properties, management is required to carefully monitor underlying assumptions, assess their impact on property values, and make significant estimates and judgments. In light of ongoing market volatility, this area warrants focused attention, as any inaccuracies in determining property values could materially affect their carrying value in the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 32 of 2021 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process.\n\n AUDITORS\u2019 RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors\u2019 report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n OTHER INFORMATION\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Integrated Annual Report (including Directors\u2019 Report), but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors\u2019 report thereon. We obtained the Directors\u2019 Report prior to the date of this auditors\u2019 report, and we expect to obtain the remaining sections of the Integrated Annual Report after that date.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4723, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afcd1c56-178e-4012-89c2-5bef7d1faa39": {"__data__": {"id_": "afcd1c56-178e-4012-89c2-5bef7d1faa39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "168395cb-5695-4cfa-82b7-ceac8ee6a04c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52f5a21afa7a3b40c6f09382b4a5b3e86d1aef899cd010553978354ff351ac4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

When the real estate assets which were previously classified as property, plant and equipment are identified for sale in the ordinary course of business, then the assets are transferred to development properties at their carrying value at the date of identification. Sale proceeds from such assets are recognised as revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nTiming of satisfaction of performance obligations\n\nThe Group is required to assess each of its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time in order to determine the appropriate method of recognising revenue. The Group has assessed that based on the sale and purchase agreements entered into with customers and the provisions of relevant laws and regulations, where contracts are entered into to provide real estate assets to customers, the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and usually has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In these circumstances the Group recognises revenue over time. For some geographies where this is not the case, revenue is recognised at a point in time.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nRevenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nThe Group recognises income from turnover rent on the basis of audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\nClassification of investment properties\n\nThe Group determines whether a property qualifies as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property. In making its judgment, the Group considers whether the property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by the Group. The Group has determined that hotels owned by the Group are to be classified as part of property, plant and equipment rather than investment properties since the Group also operates these assets.\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nOperating lease \u2013 Group as lessor\n\nThe Group has entered into commercial and retail property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and so accounts for the contracts as operating leases.\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nClassification of investments\n\nManagement designates at the time of acquisition of securities whether these should be classified as at fair value or amortised cost. In judging whether investments in securities are classified as at fair value or amortised cost, management has considered the detailed criteria for determination of such classification as set out in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n149", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3431, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6dfaa56-c0c8-4caa-a27b-ea6176e9e28d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6dfaa56-c0c8-4caa-a27b-ea6176e9e28d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a93fefa-ae65-43c1-84ad-ba6e245b84d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c52a297ed6c00e6c17f1fb88fd8ccad573eca3e82ae9c27eade9f85c07fd9403", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nSignificant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nImpairment of trade, unbilled receivables and other receivables\n\nAn estimate of the collectible amount of trade, unbilled and other receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. For individually significant amounts, this estimation is performed on an individual basis. Amounts which are not individually significant, but which are past due, are assessed collectively and a provision applied based on expected credit losses on such receivables.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional years. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nValuation of investment properties\n\nThe Group\u2019s management determines the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering the expected usage of the asset or physical wear and tear. The management periodically reviews estimated useful lives and the depreciation/amortisation method to ensure that the method and period of depreciation/amortisation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\n Hyperinflation\n\nTurkey became a hyperinflationary economy. Management have carried out a detailed assessment of the impact of applying IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and noted that there is no impact of applying IAS 29 on its operations in Turkey, as the functional and presentation currency of the subsidiaries in Turkey is US Dollars. Furthermore, management also monitors other qualitative and quantitative characteristics in its assessment of other potential hyperinflationary economies.\n\n Recognition of forfeiture income from sales cancellations\n\nUpon termination or cancellation of contracts with customers, amounts received from customers become refundable subject to forfeiture clauses contained in the original sale contract documents and as per local real estate regulations. Forfeited amounts are carried as a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position upon cancellation/termination of contract. Amounts forfeited on cancelled/terminated property units (net of customer refund where applicable) are subsequently recognised in the consolidated income statement based on management\u2019s judgment on whether the Group expects any future/continuing association with the erstwhile customer whose amounts are being forfeited.\n\n Held For sale assessment\n\nDiscussions are underway with certain buyers with regards to potential sale of stake in Emaar India Limited, however the conditions of classification as per IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are not met as at the reporting date.\n\n Measurement of progress when revenue is recognised over time\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the input method to measure the progress of performance obligations where revenue is recognised over time. The Group considers that the use of the input method which requires revenue recognition on the basis of the Group\u2019s efforts to the satisfaction of the performance obligation provides the best reference of revenue actually earned. In applying the input method, the Group estimates the cost to complete the project in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99b1ac29-7aab-4eb8-b884-533d5b01df59": {"__data__": {"id_": "99b1ac29-7aab-4eb8-b884-533d5b01df59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb649e94-29cb-47b2-9484-f859f398964f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98f9241b9c0fda2ce0221d50070d2d85faec5a08313d1aa5fe02f2be003cb73e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n For the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n ABOUT US\n\nCost to complete the projects and Project cost accruals Considering continued higher inflationary environment and currency devaluation in one of the Company\u2019s international operations, during the previous year management had reassessed value in use of investment property and property, plant and equipment thereon and recorded a net impairment charge of AED 1,109 million in investment property and AED 146 million on property, plant & equipment. The estimate of value in use for the recoverable amount was determined using a pre-tax discount rate of 16%, a terminal yield of 7% and growth rate (rent increase rate) of 6%.\n\nDuring the current period, management has reassessed the adequacy of project accruals of certain projects and accordingly has written back AED 178 million (31 December 2023: AED 2,265 million) for projects which are fully completed and wherein final settlement is either obtained or management estimates no further contractor claims. Also refer note 5 and note 13.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\nDevelopment properties are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. The cost of work-in-progress comprises construction costs and other related direct costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less cost of completion and selling expenses. During the previous year, a write down of AED 756 million were recorded for certain land parcels in few international locations where estimated net realisable value was lower than their carrying value. Also refer note 5 and note 13.\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n Taxes\n\nThe Group is subject to income and capital gains taxes in all jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the total provision for current and deferred taxes. The Group established provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provision is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretations may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n Fair value measurement\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. The external valuer report on the valuation of the Group\u2019s development properties has draw attention to the fact that a combination of global inflationary pressures, higher interest rate and recent geopolitical events have heightened the potential for greater volatility in property markets over the short-to-medium term, requiring management to closely monitor the valuation and track how market participants respond to current market volatility. Considering the current heightened geopolitical tensions, low economic growth in many major countries, and a \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rate sentiment have increased the potential for constrained credit markets, negative capital value movements and continued volatility in some property markets over the short-to-medium term, management has critically assessed asset valuations and, in the current environment, are satisfied with the assumptions adopted and valuations reported. Management will continue to closely monitor the impact of this evolving situation to assess its impact to the Group, if any.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n151", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4547, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aebc289-5c16-4344-9925-adf26bcf5d53": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aebc289-5c16-4344-9925-adf26bcf5d53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "316f9c3d-3871-4a7f-83de-56262b61f887", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb208ea856cd7851497aff690f0d587a6294f7f3c9a48435feb0d082410df1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8cebfa7e-44a2-4d0f-8d9c-0760dc803427", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Effective date\nType: date\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Non-current liability with covenants \u2013 Amendments to IAS 1 and Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Supplier Finance Arrangements \u2013 Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "04af31648d49951cb752128b14fd21f535e47c2ef31f6a4877b3198b049a39a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n For the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n ABOUT US\n\n 2.3 Changes in the Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\n 2.4 Summary of Material Accounting Policies\n\nA number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2024 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

Identify the contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.\n3. Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.\n5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation: The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:\n1. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group\u2019s performance as the Group performs; or\n2. The Group\u2019s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or\n3. The Group\u2019s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nFor performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised goods or services it creates a contract asset based on the amount of consideration earned by the Group.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n (a) New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2929, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "762e6486-5f16-4451-bb65-b534f3333177": {"__data__": {"id_": "762e6486-5f16-4451-bb65-b534f3333177", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "316f9c3d-3871-4a7f-83de-56262b61f887", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb208ea856cd7851497aff690f0d587a6294f7f3c9a48435feb0d082410df1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c38f5f37-f135-4a5c-a839-ad4764a8a471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Effective date': {0: ' ', 1: ' '}, 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)': {0: 'Non-current liability with covenants \u2013 Amendments to IAS 1 and Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)', 1: 'Supplier Finance Arrangements \u2013 Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7'}, '1 January 2024': {0: '1 January 2024', 1: '1 January 2024'}}", "table_summary": "The table outlines upcoming amendments to various International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS) that will take effect on 1 January 2024.

Where the amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised this gives rise to a contract liability. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is recognised, net of discount, in accordance with the terms of lease contracts over the lease term on a straight-line basis, except where an alternative basis is more representative of the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased asset.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nThe Group operates a loyalty points programme, \u2018U by Emaar\u2019, which allows customers to accumulate points when they spend in any of the Group\u2019s hotel or leisure units. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as they provide a material right to the customer. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative stand-alone selling price and recognised as a contract liability until the points are redeemed. Revenue is recognised upon redemption of products by the customer. When estimating the stand-alone selling price of the loyalty points, the Group considers the likelihood that the customer will redeem the points. The Group anticipates its estimates of the points that will be redeemed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the contract liability balance are charged against revenue.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLease to buy scheme\n\nSales under the lease to buy scheme are accounted for as follows:\n\n- + Rental income during the period of lease is accounted for on a straight-line basis until such time the lessee exercises its option to purchase;\n- + When the lessee exercises its option to purchase, a sale is recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policy for sale of property as stated above; and\n- + When recognising the sale, revenue is the amount payable by the lessee at the time of exercising the option to acquire the property.\n\n Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nIncome from turnover rent is recognised based on the audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n Revenue from sale of land\n\nThe performance obligation with regards to sale of land is satisfied at a point in time when customer has access to the plot. Upon recognition of revenue against a certain plot, the infrastructure cost allocated to the plot of land is released to the statement of comprehensive income, as cost of revenue.\n\n Development services\n\nRevenue from rendering of development management services is recognised when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the development obligation at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered. Revenue is recognised over time.\n\n Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n Interest income\n\nInterest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method, under which the rate used exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\n Income tax\n\nTaxation is provided in accordance with the relevant fiscal regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Current tax is the expected tax on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted as at the reporting date, and any adjustments to the tax receivable/payable in respect of prior years.

Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\n\n ABOUT US\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nDeferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purpose at the reporting date.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on laws that have been enacted as at the reporting date.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n\n- when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;\n- in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\n UAE Federal Decree-Law No (47) of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses:\n\nOn 9 December 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance released the Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses (\u2018the CT Law\u2019) to enact a Federal corporate tax (\u2018CT\u2019) regime in the UAE. The CT Law is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 June 2023. Decision No. 116 of 2022 specifies the threshold of income (as AED 375,000) over which a corporate tax of 9% would apply. For the Group, current taxes is accounted for as appropriate in the financial statements for the period beginning 1 January 2024. In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, the related deferred tax accounting impact for the UAE component has been considered for the consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\n Global Minimum Top-up Tax\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has issued the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which mandate a minimum tax rate of 15% per jurisdiction (Pillar Two). Various countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting tax legislation to fully or partially comply with Pillar Two. The United Arab Emirates, where the Group\u2019s Ultimate Parent Entity is situated, has substantively enacted the Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 2024 on the Imposition of Top-up Tax on Multinational Enterprises. The Group falls within the scope of these rules from 1 January 2025 and is currently assessing its exposure to these rules.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether the Pillar Two model rules create additional temporary differences, whether deferred taxes should be remeasured for the Pillar Two model rules, and which tax rate should be used to measure deferred taxes. In response to this uncertainty, the Group is evaluating its position.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4513, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "856f47cf-ca5a-4894-b040-dadab951d51b": {"__data__": {"id_": "856f47cf-ca5a-4894-b040-dadab951d51b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1986d59f-006c-4ec9-9773-29143e44d1eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ceedc325207d0bf7d3e8d7f2f0f15a1dda9d4b7b0e92a486fd813b88c5f02da4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78b6bd00-f825-48db-acce-e65ceca9b408", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Leasehold improvement\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Sales centres (included in land and buildings)\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Buildings\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Computers and office equipment\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Plant, machinery and heavy equipment\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Motor vehicle\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Furniture and fixture\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Leisure, entertainment and other asset\nType: string\nSummary: None"}, "hash": "24b881b23ce141c415dc7ddbb7bf678e604a620e805687ae089ae82e2919bd1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nIASB and AASB issued amendments to IAS 12 \u2018Income Taxes\u2019 on 23 May 2023 and 27 June 2023, respectively.

The development span of some of the development properties is estimated to be over 10 years.\n\nUpon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When the remaining investment in joint venture constitutes significant influence, it is accounted for as an investment in associate.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nThe management reviews the carrying values of the development properties on an annual basis.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n Inventories\n\nInventories represent consumables and other goods relating to hospitality and retail business segments of the Group. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.\n\nCosts are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on disposal or completion.\n\n Investment in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe consolidated income statement reflects the Group\u2019s share of the results of operations of its associates and joint ventures after tax and non-controlling in the subsidiaries of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the other comprehensive income or equity of an associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.\n\nThe financial statement of the associates and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associates or joint ventures. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture, and its carrying value and recognises the impairment losses in the consolidated income statement.\n\n Financial assets\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date when the purchase or sale of a financial asset is made under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are initially measured at cost, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. Trade and unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices for assets and offer prices for liabilities, at the close of business on the reporting date. If quoted market prices are not available, reference can also be made to broker or dealer price quotations.\n\nThe fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with credit institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments at the reporting date.\n\n Classification of financial assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\u2019s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group\u2019s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are \u2018solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\u2019 on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n157", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5417, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1d45b76-9484-4fb4-9946-da08c49795e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1d45b76-9484-4fb4-9946-da08c49795e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9c9c0c-0db1-4801-9857-020a43eb0060", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05acbee4fc0cb15e0f1185bd288c4f494596c2a04ae4564341d5da0f8df62c87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n ABOUT US\n\nFor the purposes of classifying financial assets, an instrument is an \u2018equity instrument\u2019 if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of \u2018equity\u2019 for the issuer (under IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation) except for certain non-derivative puttable instruments presented as equity by the issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are \u2018debt instruments\u2019.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n Equity investments\n\nAll financial assets that are equity investments are measured at fair value either through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss. This is an irrevocable choice that the Group has made on adoption of IFRS 9 or will make on subsequent acquisition of equity investments unless the equity investments are held for trading, in which case, they must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gain or loss on disposal of equity investments is not recycled. Dividend income for all equity investments is recorded through the consolidated income statement when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through P&L and OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\n Foreign exchange gains and losses\n\nThe fair value of financial assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. The foreign exchange component forms part of its fair value gain or loss. For financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, the foreign exchange component is recognised in the consolidated income statement. For financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income any foreign exchange component is recognised in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income. For foreign currency denominated debt instruments classified at amortised cost, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on the amortised cost of the asset and are recognised in the \u2018other gains and losses\u2019 line item in the consolidated income statement.\n\n Debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments are also measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) unless they are classified at amortised cost. They are classified at amortised cost only if:\n\n- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and\n- the contractual terms of the debt instrument give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding.\n\n Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, bank balances and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, net of outstanding facilities payable on demand.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n158", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3177, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13c2b9ce-c905-401f-861a-814fe5a3d04c": {"__data__": {"id_": "13c2b9ce-c905-401f-861a-814fe5a3d04c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "43cf6ba0-ac1a-4834-b0f7-2e7b4e81fbc5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "341778bc9bb53e6ec1dc2b57aeadc45a3f8369df51a0f726ecd2cd2842ba00ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit impaired. A financial asset is \u2018credit-impaired\u2019 when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flow of the financial asset have occurred.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- significant financial difficulty of the debtor;\n- a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n- it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\n- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit loss\u2019s (\u201dECL\u201d) for all debt instruments and contract assets not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset\u2019s original effective interest rate.\n\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information.\n\nFor trade and unbilled receivables and other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group\u2019s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The expected credit losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount.\n\nAn asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded entities or other available fair value indicators.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5326, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52e6299b-a6a2-4ae9-92d1-e0e194e4ab69": {"__data__": {"id_": "52e6299b-a6a2-4ae9-92d1-e0e194e4ab69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "952d0de3-c0e5-4846-a65c-8c4ff1f8d5c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1837b1d56f9fc8f00b099fe9ce71de0a6c804410a544bf95e6ed73da73df318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group\n\nDebt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual agreements. Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivative instrument as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at the initial recognition.\n\n Sukuk\n\nThe sukuk are stated at amortised cost using the effective profit rate method. Profit attributable to the sukuk is calculated by applying the prevailing market profit rate, at the time of issue, for similar sukuk instruments and any difference with the profit distributed is added to the carrying amount of the sukuk. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability component.\n\n Other financial liabilities\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.\n\nLease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.\n\nThe lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nLoans and borrowings\n\nTerm loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n160", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5034, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6c8f8e4-d31a-465f-a98a-38242c0b53a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6c8f8e4-d31a-465f-a98a-38242c0b53a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21678f4c-e3d8-4c0e-be3a-f3ab51c762b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff793a78ffa72efade1bc4e85494e71e14b2a0754fac75cb092d15c7aaabb821", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\n ABOUT US\n\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\n\nIf the Company acquires an asset or a group of assets (including any liabilities assumed) that does not constitute a business, then the transaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3 because it cannot meet the definition of a business combination. Such transactions are accounted for as asset acquisitions in which the cost of acquisition is generally allocated between the individual identifiable assets and liabilities in the Group based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. They do not give rise to goodwill or a gain on a bargain purchase.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group\u2019s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in consolidated income statement.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nOffsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n ANNEXURES\n\nThe Company may acquire a group of assets and assume liabilities in an asset acquisition that require valuation reports to complete the allocation of cost. The measurement and allocation of cost in an asset acquisition are completed at the date of recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if there are any. Unlike for a business combination, there is no measurement period for an asset acquisition. This is regardless of the size or complexity of the acquisition.\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed (except if related to issue of debt or equity).\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at fair value on the date of acquisition. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the consolidated income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\n\nWhere goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5031, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7450fc6c-3e5d-46f5-96e9-b1ab70ace3cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7450fc6c-3e5d-46f5-96e9-b1ab70ace3cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31b4b49a-125d-4c82-b7fa-d8c048031fd2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f2d1ea996aca94d41456b2c5ec506266f99e55e4960e43e6f686eaa4114898c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually as at the reporting date and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n ABOUT US\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\n ANNEXURES\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as investment in securities and hedges, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\n Fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows:\n\n- + Level 1 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in an active market (that are unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities.\n- + Level 2 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- + Level 3 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n Foreign currency translations\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in AED which is the functional currency of the Company. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4341, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "677661b4-9b7e-4d80-963c-71dc92b2f2c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "677661b4-9b7e-4d80-963c-71dc92b2f2c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fda954e7-2e40-4374-8bf6-af5d886f1af6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1431e4a7c3395b9db020a49e33a4d8bd4203ad8ccc2b0fae1635d2acd1ca930e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\n Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operation including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the reporting date.

If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n 3. Segment Information\n\nManagement monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n Business segments\n\nBusiness segment is the primary segment of the Group. For management purposes, the Group is organised into three major segments, namely, real estate (develop, sell and manage condominiums, villas, commercial units and plots of land), leasing, retail and related activities (develop, lease and manage malls, retail, commercial and residential spaces) and hospitality (develop, own and/or manage hotels, serviced apartments and leisure activities). Other segments include businesses that individually do not meet the criteria for a reportable segment as per IFRS 8 \u2018Operating Segments\u2019.

The additional deferred tax liabilities recognised during the year mainly relates to the purchase price allocation impact due to the acquisition of a subsidiary in Egypt and temporary differences arising in Egypt from unrealised income. Furthermore, the recent implementation of the UAE corporate tax law also led to recognition of deferred tax liability on previously recognised goodwill.\n\nThe Group has recognised income tax expense based on the estimate made by the management. The Group\u2019s operations in the UAE are subject to income tax with effect from 1 January 2023. The Group ETR is lower primarily due to the relief available by application of Ministerial Decision 120 of 2023 (\u2018MD 120\u2019) under Transitional rules for Federal Decree Law No. 47 of 2022 on taxation of Corporation and Businesses on immovable properties in the UAE.\n\nTo ensure compliance and obtain further clarity on the appropriate method for calculating the impact of MD 120, a formal clarification request has been submitted to the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) of the UAE. Pending formal clarification, management has recognised the tax relief based on the most likely and probable amount, aligning with the principles of IFRIC 23 \u2018Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments\u2019.

Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment at each reporting date that represents its estimate of expected credit losses in respect of trade, unbilled and other receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group has calibrated the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\n\n RESPONSIBLE VALUE CREATION\n\nOther financial assets and cash deposits\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise bank balances and cash, investment in securities, loans to associates and joint ventures, other receivables and deposits, the Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets.\n\n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group\u2019s policy. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only placing balances with local and international banks of good repute. Given the profile of its bankers, management does not expect any counterparty to fail in meeting its obligations. Investment in securities measured at amortised cost were subject to 12-month ECL and the credit rating was B-.\n\n CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n a) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk principally from its receivables from customers, other receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. Total financial assets at amortised cost amounted to AED 70,026,631 thousand (2023: AED 54,980,702 thousand) as at the reporting date.\n\n Trade, unbilled and other receivables\n\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group\u2019s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate has less influence on credit risk. The Group earns its revenues from a large number of customers spread across different geographies. However, 97% (2023: 98%) of the Group\u2019s trade and unbilled receivables are from the Group\u2019s operations that are based in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts for the sale of residential and commercial units and plots of land on an instalment basis. The instalments are specified in the contracts. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of instalments due. However, the legal ownership of residential, commercial units and plots of land is transferred to the buyer only after all the instalments are recovered. In addition, instalment dues are monitored on an ongoing basis as evidenced by the Group\u2019s low level of bad debts.\n\n Excessive risk of concentration\n\nConcentration arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry. In order to avoid excessive concentration of risk, the Group\u2019s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.\n\n INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n\n190", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4421, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d1eb503-58ce-441f-bb3b-210df3881412": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d1eb503-58ce-441f-bb3b-210df3881412", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4007ccf2-772b-4845-bea0-5c664b6246dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d01292808637f56f6487f25cb59122e81f8282eba9580bdaa16934597fab958b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "EMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n                                                          Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nINTRODUCTION                                              For the year ended 31 December 2024\nABOUT US                                                            The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of           The investments in financial products are not for trading or speculative purposes but\n                                                                   each class of financial assets.                                                              placed in securities or fixed deposits, with the objective of achieving better returns\n                                                                                                                                                                than cash at bank.

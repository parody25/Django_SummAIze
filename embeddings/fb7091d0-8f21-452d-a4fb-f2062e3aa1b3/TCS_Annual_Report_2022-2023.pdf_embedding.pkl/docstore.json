In FY 2023, your company delivered revenue of \u20b9225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6%. This growth has come at an industry-leading operating margin of 24.1%.\n\nTCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable their business transformation, helping them accelerate new technology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest in research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base.\n\nYour company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by new customer additions and deep client relationships. In FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance across markets and industry verticals. The order book continues to be strong, indicating demand for your company\u2019s services.\n\nFrom a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over 614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates. As the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also assessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness the global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models of work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective employee engagement and collaboration.\n\nThe global environment is going through considerable changes. Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the overall economic environment.\n\nAt the same time, the world is navigating several transitions. Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge growth opportunity for the IT industry. Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities which include products and platforms that are AI-powered.\n\nOver the last few years, your company has leveraged partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer. We will also invest in research areas important for the future, in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up ecosystem.\n\nThe global energy transition is accelerating. Businesses are making clear commitments towards a sustainable future. There are many innovations across products, services, manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also emerging. This requires investments in technology and innovation including electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be an important enabler for businesses.\n\nThe supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political situation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency. New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital investments in technology to set-up \u2018digital-first\u2019 manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem integration with partners.\n\nIn the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition.\n\nI would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution during his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for the future. I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the very best in his new role as CEO & MD of your company.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nN Chandrasekaran\n\nChairman", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4430, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d219e98-b043-4340-acdd-d9dc7987657d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d219e98-b043-4340-acdd-d9dc7987657d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e9fd414d-acca-4e44-83b8-58a1d7440346", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9862ad21c8daa535496ff0e5fa1895d4e2ce84035a1d4914993d97f3e3dfcd4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Letter to Shareholders\n\nDear Stakeholder,\n\nDemand for our services showed remarkable resilience even as other parts of the technology universe deflated, and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major markets throughout FY 2023. Our revenue for the year was \u20b9225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6% over the prior year (13.7% in constant currency).\n\nThis growth came with an industry leading operating margin of 24.1%. Our Net Margin was at 18.7%. The Earnings Per Share was at \u20b9115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.\n\nFrom an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY 2023 was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew 22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2% and Communications, Media and Technology which grew 18.1%. Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.6% while Manufacturing grew 14.1%. Others, which make up 8.2% of revenues, grew 22.5%.\n\nBy geographic markets, North America grew 24.2%, UK grew 11.4% and Continental Europe grew 9.2%. Among emerging markets, Latin America grew 24.8%, India grew 14.9%, Middle East & Africa grew 12.5% while Asia Pacific grew 7.1%.\n\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of \u20b924 per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to \u20b9115 per share. For the full year, the company\u2019s shareholder payout was \u20b942,079 crore, 108.2% of the free cash flow during the year.\n\n# Innovate, Adapt, Thrive\n\nOur performance this year reflects how much of an enterprise staple IT services have become. Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad. During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead.\n\nCloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution. They engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and depth of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge, strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.\n\nWe also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing cloud expenses. In some cases, it required rearchitecting their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times. Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed services to rein in cloud costs.\n\nThe adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive innovation within enterprises.

Newer developments like generative AI, large language models, and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and innovation by our clients. Our investments in research and innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up during the year, bringing the total to 30 clients.\n\nSome of the emerging innovation themes that we helped customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector; AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail industries. As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their spends and showing greater interest in such operating model transformations.\n\nWithin our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business model innovation continued to be a key theme. For example, TCS Cognix\u2122, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite has been a game changer, enabling faster transformations for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service delivery platform central to their new business model of providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of various home appliances to households. Its 600 pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug and play transformation of a range of business and technology functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have used it to transform their business and IT operations.\n\nIngram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from a traditional distributor to a platform company that does distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their omnichannel modernization and transform the customer journey experience. In traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services integrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements of the operation stack \u2013 processes, applications, and the underlying technology and infrastructure \u2013 with a single strategic partner, clients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce complexity and derisk their larger business transformations.

So when health-tech giant Royal Philips sold Philips Domestic Appliances in 2021 to Hillhouse, a private equity firm, the standalone company, rebranded as Versuni, saw the separation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to wipe the slate clean and transform into a digitally lean, agile, and innovation-led organization.\n\nVersuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from strategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first application landscape. The program entailed decoupling the company from the parent\u2019s systems, while simultaneously transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious 2-year timeframe.\n\nThe business transformation, enabled by SAP as the digital core, establishes best practices-based processes from the consumer products market and pursue its vision of turning houses into homes, and building lifetime engagement with consumers.\n\nEnhancements were made to deliver superior business outcomes across every function. Integrating supply chain planning with factory scheduling will enable higher warehouse productivity and more timely shipments. AI-powered insights in finance will help improve cash flow, free up cash and drive efficiencies in back-office functions. The new people processes will provide a better employee experience and enable a more responsive HR function.\n\nI am really happy to have partnered with TCS in this journey. TCS has been an invaluable partner in our process and digital transformation journey with SAP as the main enabling technology suite. The hard work and dedication demonstrated by each member of the TCS team has not gone unnoticed.

The TCS team\u2019s contextual knowledge of the Eversource business and technology landscape resulted in a high quality solution that helped meet the regulatory mandate as well as Eversource\u2019s clean energy and energy affordability goals.\n\nEversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that operates New England\u2019s largest energy delivery system, with 4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA) and New Hampshire. It is focused on making its operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more clean and affordable energy to New England.\n\nEversource partnered with TCS to build a solution that would help them on-board distributed solar power capacity within its grid by purchasing power from residential, industrial and commercial customers who install solar panels and storage on their properties, and enabling them to avail of incentives offered by their respective states, as part of state-level Net Zero programs.\n\nThe TCS-built solution includes onboarding of new solar customers, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, and a pricing engine that uses a declining block pricing mechanism to incentivize early enrolment as a producer. It also includes a billing system that processes recovery charges, solar credits and incentive payments, and enables flexible payment options as well as hardship relief options to improve affordability and increase adoption of energy efficiency programs.\n\nTo facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS architected a reusable framework that would simplify adoption of each state\u2019s incentive program into Eversource\u2019s core platform, enabling the utility to pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for each state.\n\nUsing this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage state incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while driving growth of its clean energy business. At the same time, it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power, accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but also that of the states it services.\n\nDavid Coco\n\nDirector, IT Business Solutions\n\nEversource Energy\n\nCustomer Stories | 27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2546, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0edd6786-6905-47c9-8f5f-c95aa6a5823c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0edd6786-6905-47c9-8f5f-c95aa6a5823c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba2c6a0c-e7e9-4d0e-942c-21d5dacfc389", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f32f090363d36d5b1461aac95d8650ec32dbde196b7a2c9a5ca7cefb2237fbfd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat\n\n# K Ananth Krishnan\n\n# Harrick Vin\n\nHow does TCS help clients innovate, adapt and thrive?\n\nKAK: With all the geo-political tension and economic uncertainty in today\u2019s world, companies need to respond quickly to events on the ground and cope with surprises, while staying focused on fulfilling customer needs and wants, with innovative products and services.\n\nTCS helps them on both these fronts. We help build a future-ready, digital core that enables quick, insights-driven decision making. We transform IT and business operating models using technology, making them more efficient, agile and responsive, freeing up resources to support innovation. Partnering with us enables our clients to try out a larger number of innovative ideas quickly, and launch new products, services and business models to drive growth and transformation.\n\nInnovate, Adapt, Thrive refers to how our scale, full services capability and innovation offerings enable our clients to respond to short-term challenges while accelerating their pursuit of longer-term aspirations.\n\nInnovation is about having a lightbulb moment. How do you scale that?\n\nHV: People often relate innovations to serendipitous discoveries. We help clients structure and scale the innovation process using the TCS Agile Innovation Cloud (AIC). This framework brings together the best of TCS\u2019 talent, research and innovation inputs, global capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and speed up \u2018Ideas to Outcomes\u2019.\n\nFor an insurance major, we worked with the client\u2019s teams and collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of brainstorming workshops using the Clay Map. Leveraging our AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24 progressed to become MVPs.\n\nOne reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their contextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the client\u2019s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply rooted in that organization\u2019s reality and therefore more likely to succeed.\n\nGenerative AI is the talk of the season. What is the business opportunity around it?\n\nKAK: We see interest in exploring use cases right across the enterprise. The most obvious areas are conversational systems, content creation and digital marketing, and activities which require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text, images and higher-level abstraction.\n\nLegal and procurement teams can use it to trawl through contracts to identify specific clauses, or prepare a summary of variations of a particular clause. HR could use it for handling employee queries. Sales and customer service want smart assistants that can explain product features and answer questions. In IT, generative AI can create basic code snippets or quality check developed code for adherence to standards.\n\nThese are just the initial ideas based on the standalone capabilities of generative AI. Over time, you will see newer use cases that are more combinatorial, driving greater spending by enterprises and expanding the opportunity significantly.\n\nIf generative AI takes over coding, won\u2019t the IT services industry become redundant?\n\nKAK: Software that writes software has been around for a long time. In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS\u2019 very first offshore development project, delivered using an in-house code generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC was famous for its tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators on demand, converting source code from any programming language to any other language.\n\nTCS MasterCraft\u2122 is today used by hundreds of our clients for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS BaNCS\u2122, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even though there is effort involved in defining the model up-front, clients see significant productivity benefits.\n\nThe new low code, no code platforms have done away even with those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build sophisticated applications very quickly. And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has only led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption, with volume growth more than making up for the effort deflation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4633, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f32b42f1-e48c-45a0-aa44-2fb16c40ce7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f32b42f1-e48c-45a0-aa44-2fb16c40ce7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fce8da36-2a4b-475c-a82f-6dbc054f0e1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4cd053452247061faefb1ed4e1b6f5061cf97778f70349be2cbaa6f011e4817", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "What is the evidence for this thesis? platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in,\n\nHV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of technology has led to reduction in programming effort per function point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over decades.\n\nTake for example, the switch from assembly language to C. Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The 10x effort deflation didn\u2019t result in mass layoffs of programmers. Instead, there was an explosion in software development because the same IT team could now build ten times as many function points.\n\nWe scaled up our Research and Innovation, exploring use cases across different industries, creating solutions and showcasing them at our innovation centers. We expanded COIN, created new innovation frameworks and set up Pace Ports, our co-innovation hubs, across the world. Today, we not only have a large number of patents, but also the largest portfolio of products and platforms in our peer set, helping win large transformational engagements that uniquely distinguish us.\n\nSimilarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a big cost deflation, but nobody\u2019s IT budgets deflated. Instead, those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded. Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms.\n\nWhy is that so? Farm mechanization caused effort deflation and rendered the agricultural workforce redundant in the West.\n\nKAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the effort deflation because there was only so much land available to till.\n\nDemand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise, there is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then, the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on business users\u2019 ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.\n\nHV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas, experimentation and more demand for our services. To that extent, business application of generative AI, along with other technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity. We are the launch partner for their latest offerings, whether it is AWS\u2019 Mainframe Modernization, Finspace, and IoT Fleetwise offerings, or Azure\u2019s Sustainability, Supply Chain Platform, and Financial Services and Retail Industry Cloud, and now for Google Cloud\u2019s Generative AI solutions.\n\nIndian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new technologies. Will that change with generative AI?\n\nKAK: We have been leaders for a while, but perceptions can be too rooted in historic stereotypes to recognize the change. Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India. A similar model is powering start-up banks in Israel today.\n\nInnovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat | 29", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3858, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37d7fe4f-5744-449e-a3aa-8d6f6dbe6bf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "37d7fe4f-5744-449e-a3aa-8d6f6dbe6bf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67605d3e-92e5-4c14-9795-5d2ba1f6f6b9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93aa077cb99e4154c9a64776d617caf9de403a116f7583def9443a1f62037d69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Revolutionizing Small Value Payments in South Africa\n\nBankservAfrica, Africa\u2019s leading automated clearing house, has been facilitating payments in South Africa and the region for over five decades through its seamless interbank clearing and settlement services. It has a track record of pioneering innovations like the SASWITCH, a national network of interoperable ATMs, in the mid-80s.\n\nWhen the South African Reserve Bank unveiled its Vision 2025 strategy to reform the South African national payment system framework, BankservAfrica took the lead along with its ecosystem partners, and engaged TCS to build a new platform for rapid payments that would usher in the era of modern, cost-effective, instant digital payments on the continent.\n\nTCS designed a high availability, containerized, cloud optimized solution with TCS BaNCS for Market Infrastructure at its core, using high performance microservices for clearing and payment. Hosted on a public cloud, the solution is very resilient and can auto-scale.\n\nOn the front-end, users can make a payment, or a request for payment, through a payment service called PayShap, formally launched in March 2023. Very conveniently, users don\u2019t need to enter the recipient\u2019s bank account or branch code details to make payments. Instead, they can use a unique identifier such as the recipient\u2019s mobile number, or a bank-generated identification number, which serves as a proxy for the full banking details. This proxy and resolution is enabled through a tamper-proof blockchain-based solution powered by TCS\u2019 Quartz Smart Solution.\n\nBy democratizing access to a frictionless system for low value payments, TCS\u2019 innovative solution for BankservAfrica has the potential to reduce the use of cash for small transactions and accelerate formalization of the unorganized sector. It will drive new fee-based revenues for banks, and also offer customer insights with which they can offer credit to more consumers. This will not only improve financial inclusion, but also add to South Africa\u2019s GDP growth \u2013 a fitting outcome for two very purpose-driven organizations that came together to build this platform of national importance.\n\nBankservAfrica views cost-effective digital payments as a pathway to improving credit access and financial inclusion in South Africa. After an extensive evaluation, we selected TCS for their deep understanding of the payments ecosystem, global experience, technological expertise, intellectual property and shared values. The outcome has been very gratifying. By changing consumer behaviors, PayShap has the potential to reshape sectors and transform the South African economy.\n\nRoshan Moonsamy\n\nInterim CEO and CFO\n\nBankservAfrica\n\nCustomer Stories | 30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2724, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a08bdd9-a3c3-45c4-b24c-94e2b81e415b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a08bdd9-a3c3-45c4-b24c-94e2b81e415b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5698501c-5cac-4171-9cf0-b27ee8647681", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7715dcac2d5f62a9580834401ffe21722d5de54d7aaf16d97dd04ce66db4975a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Supporting Takenaka Corporation\n\nWe selected TCS for supporting our digital transformation not only because of its accumulated global knowledge and technological capabilities, but also because throughout the long histories of both companies, there is a common bond in our corporate cultures of valuing stakeholders, including society and customers as well as employees. Building 4.0 will turn the dreams of our stakeholders into reality, and we would like to develop it as a foundation to connect with a sustainable society of the future.\n\nFounded by a master builder (toryo) more than 400 years ago, Takenaka Corporation has specialized in building construction with an integrated design-build approach that includes initial planning and aftercare services like maintenance. It has redefined urban landscapes in Japan and around the world, with famous landmarks like Tokyo Tower and Changi International Airport. At the core of its longstanding business success is its passion for innovation rooted in its toryo spirit, quality management, and its commitment to realizing a sustainable society.\n\nTakenaka\u2019s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial revolution in the building industry by embracing digital transformation across the construction value chain. It is addressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such as labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase employee productivity and improve the work-life balance of employees. Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design and construction planning, next-generation work sites with construction robots and remotely operated cranes, and environmentally conscious smart buildings with intelligent controls using IoT. The foundation for this innovation is the Building 4.0TM digital platform, which is being developed and operated in partnership with TCS.\n\nBuilding 4.0TM will integrate data from sales, design, estimation, engineering, construction management, facilities management services, human resources and accounting. This will enable superior decision-making across a wide range of operations through advanced analysis using machine learning and AI. In building design, for example, structural engineers can use AI-based cross-section estimations to more efficiently implement optimal structural designs. In construction, it can enable better construction planning using accurate forecasts of materials and personnel required to achieve target schedules, improve visibility of project progress, and enhance labor productivity.\n\nTCS is supporting Takenaka in promoting innovation, building construction digital twins, simulating human behavior, utilizing business efficiency. Through Building 4.0TM, Takenaka will continue to create new value for society and customers while improving knowledge of the construction field, and exploring \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. The knowledge gained from these efforts will help Takenaka develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions through better designs, understand project risks, and improve KPIs for quality, cost, schedule, safety, and the environment.\n\nlocal communities.\n\nCustomer Stories | 31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3131, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58650e88-1b0e-4847-b256-af0015e73d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "58650e88-1b0e-4847-b256-af0015e73d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b88e764-8d3a-4f44-ac2f-a442e39d3800", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20c5e90082eb25817113eeec8918fd6ca338380b5a0c541447f2a0fec6e24dc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Q&amp;A with Samir Seksaria Milind Lakkad\n\n# CFO CHRO\n\nYou stood out in the industry with virtually zero attrition at senior levels. Now you had CEO-level attrition for the first time in your history. What does this say about your retention of senior talent?\n\nSS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn\u2019t call a tailwind. We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from backfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee cost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefully we won\u2019t have any new headwind due to attrition in FY 2024.\n\nML: One swallow does not a summer make. This unprecedented event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too, and might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just like anybody else. As for our track record in retaining senior leadership talent, it remains industry-leading. I am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business heads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS. We have over 125,000 TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years in TCS. This cohort represents the true strength of TCS. They are the custodians of our culture, values and institutional memory, and have been central to our ability to weather the unprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting it affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients have come to expect from TCS.\n\nYou won many large outsourcing deals in FY 2023, and your highest ever number of large deals in Q4. Won\u2019t this hurt margins in FY 2024?\n\nSS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily margin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between 24 and 26 percent. Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct them. A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost reduction at the time of contract renewal.

Customers have really taken to this idea.\n\n# Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your margins?\n\nIn FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation deals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18 in the prior year.\n\nSS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this will get adjusted.\n\n# Attrition among women is higher than for men. Why? How are you addressing this?\n\nML: Historically, women\u2019s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men\u2019s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalized.\n\nThe higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up 23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for only 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1% of our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce.\n\n# Why is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let employees continue to work from home?\n\nML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn\u2019t the case with more junior employees. Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team-building suffered a lot in these two years.\n\nThen there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our workforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.\n\n# With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile doing similar work?\n\nML: Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem. The pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons.\n\nSS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based just on the productivity improvements in code generation using generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which is freely available to everyone \u2013 service providers as well as clients\u2019 IT teams \u2013 can change relative competitiveness and by extension, margins.

Central banks raised interest rates sharply in response. As a result, the global GDP is estimated to have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the prior year.\n\n1. The outperformance may be attributed to market share gains resulting from TCS\u2019 longer-term, purpose-driven partnerships with its customers, its agile organization structure, and a very stable management team; its investments in organic talent development, research and innovation, intellectual property and building newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet share with clients; and better execution resulting in greater customer satisfaction.\n\nGlobal technology spending on Enterprise software and IT services crossed the $2 trillion mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY. IT services grew 3.5% YoY, to $1,250 billion. This growth was led by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital transformation to cover more back-office operational areas.\n\nThe global IT services industry continues to be a highly fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT services providers globally, with a market share of 2.2%, and has outperformed the market, growing significantly higher than market growth over the last decade.\n\nTCS is an IT services, consulting and business solutions organization partnering many of the world\u2019s largest businesses in their transformational journeys for the last 55 years. It has a global presence, deep domain expertise in multiple industry verticals and a complete portfolio of offerings \u2013 grouped under consulting and service integration, application services, digital transformation services, cloud services, engineering services, cognitive business operations, and products and platforms \u2013 targeting every C-suite stakeholder.\n\nThe company leverages all these capabilities and its deep contextual knowledge of its customers\u2019 businesses to craft unique, high quality, high impact solutions designed to deliver differentiated business outcomes. These solutions are delivered using its Secure Borderless Workspaces\u2122 (SBWS\u2122) operating model which enables a highly distributed, Location Independent Agile\u2122 delivery.\n\nTCS geographic footprint covers North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, India and Middle-East Africa.\n\nTCS considers industry verticals as its primary go-to-market business segments. The key vertical clusters are: Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI), Communication, Media and Technology (CMT), Retail and Consumer Business, Life Sciences and Healthcare, Manufacturing and Others.\n\n# Strategy for Sustainable Growth\n\nCustomer-centricity is at the heart of TCS\u2019 strategy, organization structure and investment decisions. TCS\u2019 customer-centric worldview helps spot trends early, embrace business opportunities by making the right investments and mitigating risks while discharging its social and environmental responsibilities.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23\n\nManagement Discussion and Analysis | 86", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3546, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d274599e-aa40-41ff-a365-eda9efe64b23": {"__data__": {"id_": "d274599e-aa40-41ff-a365-eda9efe64b23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b64bea0a-1c73-4a15-b56d-4854a3a1db5b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba2381f41455fdb89549ab660438788523e9962d1c89a1df8dd737186ebf922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "TCS has been broadening and deepening customer relationships by continually looking for new opportunities and newer areas in their businesses to add value, proactively investing in building newer capabilities, reskilling its workforce and launching newer services, solutions, products and platforms to address those opportunities. The Pace Ports at Pittsburgh in the US, in the Carnegie Mellon University campus, and the other in Toronto, Canada, were formally inaugurated this year. Including the ones in Tokyo, New York and Amsterdam, the company has five Pace Ports in all.\n\nThe company launched joint innovation hubs as well, using the TCS Pace\u2122 framework. TCS and Boots launched an agile incubator called INNOVATE Powered by TCS Pace\u2122, at Boots\u2019 Nottingham headquarters in the UK. TCS forged a major applied engineering and research partnership with The National Robotarium, UK\u2019s largest and most advanced AI and robotics research centre, located at Heriot-Watt University\u2019s Edinburgh campus.\n\nThese growth and transformation (G&T) engagements are higher value engagements catering to the needs of a broader set of stakeholders in the client organization, enjoying greater visibility within the CXO suite and more closely aligned with their business strategy. An expanding share of this business is helping drive a steady increase in the scope and scale of services consumed year after year, and an expansion of TCS\u2019 share of wallet, as evidenced by the client metrics.\n\nOver time, this strategy has resulted in deep and enduring customer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of the addressable market, and a proven track record in delivering longer term stakeholder value.\n\n# Enabling Investments\n\nTCS pioneered the use of the word \u2018digital\u2019 to describe the new family of technologies that emerged in the last decade. Quick to recognize the potential of cloud, the company made investments ahead of time in launching new platform-based business models as far back as in 2009, reskilling the workforce, research and innovation, building collaborative workspaces and innovation centers, intellectual property, and alliances and partnerships. Those early investments have given TCS a head start in participating in its customers\u2019 G&T journeys.\n\nThe company continues to invest in co-innovation hubs, launching TCS Pace Ports\u2122 in major markets. TCS teams use these physical spaces to work with academic and start-up partners, ideate jointly with client teams and rapidly build solutions. In FY 2023, TCS Dexam\u2122, TCS DigiGov\u2122, TCS Cognitive Plant Operations, T Mobility Cloud Suite and TCS ESG Integrator were added to the list of existing solutions like TCS Omnistore\u2122, TCS MasterCraft\u2122 5G Edge Suite, TwinX, TCS Clever Energy\u2122, TCS IP2\u2122 and TCS Envirozone\u2122.\n\n# Strategic Responses to Opportunities and Threats\n\n|Opportunity / Threat|TCS Approach|Outcomes|\n|---|---|---|\n|Macroeconomic uncertainty impacting decision making and prompting cost reduction initiatives|\u2022 Proven track record in helping enterprises reduce their cost of operations. \u2022 Proactive pitching of IT and business operating model transformations that not only deliver greater efficiency, but also enhance enterprise agility, resilience and throughput. \u2022 Leveraging full services capability and deep client relationships to propose product-aligned operating models. \u2022 Use of TCS Cognix\u2122 to accelerate operations transformation, using over 600 pre-built automation components that infuse AI/ML and other technologies into IT and business processes to reduce human intervention, increase velocity and throughput.|\u2022 Strong deal flow resulting in a robust order book that gives better visibility of medium-term growth. \u2022 Market share gains in vendor consolidations. \u2022 Efficiency gains helping fund client\u2019s transformation programs in some instances. \u2022 TCS Cognix recognized as a means of driving quicker realization of RoI and used by nearly 300 clients.|\n\n4Ref AR FY 2012, MD&A, Pages 25, 29\n\n5Ref AR FY 2010, Letter from CEO, Page 7\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Management Discussion and Analysis | 87", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4136, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1a0edd-2711-42ff-9494-6a033f193d7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1a0edd-2711-42ff-9494-6a033f193d7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4c1f74e-66f7-479b-bedf-9bcec591cc42", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd51177e38192382e055299fa9bf850604425150de43b56734c214e30901782", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Opportunity / Threat\n\n|TCS Approach|Outcomes|\n|---|---|\n|Greater interest in using technology to drive business growth and differentiation - Focused on developing contextual knowledge and applying that for inside-out transformations.\n- Continued investments in research and innovation, TCS Pace Ports, and intellectual property (IP).\n- Dedicated practice with domain experts to bring together TCS\u2019 differentiated capabilities from across the organization to stitch together comprehensive solutions.\n- Proactive pitching of solutions to customers\u2019 most pressing business problems.\n- New brand tagline \u2018Building on Belief\u2019 to strengthen positioning as a growth and transformation partner.\n|- Expansion of addressable market.\n- Growing share of G&T business adding to growth.\n- Higher quality revenue, lending margin resilience.\n- More deeply embedded in the client\u2019s business.\n- Engaging with a broader set of buyers in the client organization.\n- Higher visibility within C-Suites.\n|\n|Accelerated adoption of public cloud - Dedicated business units with end to end capabilities on each of the hyperscaler platforms.\n- Continued investment by each of these units in skills, certifications, credentials, IP and accelerators.\n- Articulated the multi-horizon cloud transformation framework.\n- Made available TCS products and solutions on public clouds.\n|- Strong growth in cloud transformation revenues.\n- Top tier partner to each of the hyperscalers.\n- Preferred partner to clients seeking to use cloud native capabilities to power their growth and transformation.\n- Over 110,000 hyperscaler-certified employees.\n|\n|Greater acceptance of as-a-Service platforms - Strengthened alliances and launched new offerings around the popular and new SaaS products.\n- Helped ISV* clients upgrade their products to launch new SaaS versions.\n- Partnering with product manufacturers to help launch innovative as-a-Service offerings using TCS Bringing Life to Things IoT framework.\n- Promoted SaaS versions of in-house product portfolio, now available on hyperscaler platforms.\n- Used IP portfolio to launch new platforms that bundle IP and shared services on the cloud.\n|- Stronger win-win partnerships.\n- Expansion of addressable market.\n- Strong growth in SaaS sales.\n- Platforms drive stickier relationships, with long term revenue visibility.\n|\n\n* Independent Software Vendor\n\n# Talent Management\n\nTCS aims to attract, develop, motivate and retain diverse talent, that is critical for its competitive differentiation and continued success.

Other highlights include:\n\n# Talent Acquisition\n\nIn FY 2023, TCS responded with agility to the changing supply side dynamics which saw the unprecedented industry-wide employee churn peaking mid-year, then falling sharply in the latter half. This entailed recalibrating talent acquisition dynamically to fully utilize the additional capacity built up in the prior year. The company remains the preferred employer and one of the largest job creators in IT services in several major markets, for both freshers and lateral hires. In addition to about 44,000 fresh engineers, TCS onboarded its highest ever number of lateral recruits during the year. It also pivoted from a virtual-only mode to a hybrid model of virtual and in-person recruitment focused on attracting the right talent, creating better employee experiences, and building the TCS brand.\n\n# Key Achievements:\n\n- TCS National Qualifier Test: Over 618,000 students from more than 4,200 institutes in India competed for the opportunity to work for TCS.\n- Hiring from India\u2019s top B-schools, including the top 3 IIMs, continues with internship and placement offers as part of the strategic leadership program.\n- TCS CareersNext: TCS\u2019 virtual career fair platform was leveraged for conducting 3 virtual hiring drives in this year, yielding over 32,000 registrations and 8,000 job applications.\n- TCS HackQuest, the company\u2019s flagship ethical hacking competition now in its 7th season saw over 58,000 registrations from more than 3,000 institutes across India.\n- Programs to improve diversity in hiring produced encouraging outcomes.

In major economies, the heightened risk of a recession \u2013 made worse by a banking crisis \u2013 has led to uncertainty in enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on capex and certain discretionary programs. If the delayed decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023 flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong growth.\n\nDespite this, spending on IT services has been resilient so far. Key demand drivers expected to power the company\u2019s growth in FY 2024 include:\n\n- Technology transformation: IT infrastructure modernization, cloud enablement, application and data estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins, cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/Edge and AI adoption.\n\n8IMF World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Management Discussion and Analysis | 94", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2491, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ce22b6c-be2f-4dd4-8dff-82cbb55c7dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ce22b6c-be2f-4dd4-8dff-82cbb55c7dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f693cc9f-4d6c-48cf-b45a-836ce4323b2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "651bc0cdc0647dc351bebbf47027fc023e1946106d59416a34bc524f6aaaa5e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022   G&amp;T: Customer experience transformation using knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact of hybrid modes of working.

LLP, the statutory auditors of TCS have audited the financial statements included in this annual report and have issued an attestation report on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies Act, 2013).\n\nTCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, on the lines of the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. The Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization\u2019s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.\n\nTCS\u2019 internal controls are commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with authority limits for approving contracts as well as expenditure. Processes for formulating and reviewing annual and long-term business plans have been laid down.\n\nTCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with global best practices.\n\nTCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation 17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI LODR) as of March 31, 2023. Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies Act 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR), TCS\u2019 Audit Committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the company\u2019s internal financial controls were adequate and operating effectively.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Management Discussion and Analysis | 105", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2453, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6903c561-3bee-4ada-b491-d2de78988a7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6903c561-3bee-4ada-b491-d2de78988a7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f8e89a5-ef61-4e34-825c-02f3ca2523ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b502023d881c89ba70faedd0751e9c2400b72627668648273df1af76a2588df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52ecce91-2e96-41c7-ae7e-4eb55c3a2691", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4dac119a361aaa30ddac69bfe0bc9726170ccf02da56b978fa2d5d00b746fbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Performance Trend \u2013 10 years\n\n|(\u20b9 Crore)|FY 2014|FY 2015|FY 2015#|FY 2016|FY 2017|FY 2018|FY 2019|FY 2020|FY 2021|FY 2021*|FY 2022|FY 2023|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Revenue from operations|94,648|94,648|94,648|108,646|117,966|123,104|146,463|156,949|164,177|164,177|191,754|225,458|\n|Total revenue from operations|94,648|94,648|94,648|108,646|117,966|123,104|146,463|156,949|164,177|164,177|191,754|225,458|\n|Revenue by geographic segments| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|Americas|5,488|6,108|6,729|7,415|7,921|8,393|8,964|8,449|8,449|9,805|10,072|11,271|\n|Europe|196|196|197|197|191|375|375|370|370|366|366|366|\n|India|7,629|51,053|60,011|66,091|66,145|77,562|82,000|84,278|84,278|61,142|67,436|67,436|\n|Others|3,434|26,730|29,092|30,038|34,155|43,456|48,037|52,346|52,346|20,735|11,271|22,415|\n|Cost| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|Employee cost|40,486|50,924|55,348|61,621|66,396|78,246|85,952|91,814|91,814|31,143|38,677|59,259|\n|Other operating cost|16,170|19,242|22,621|24,034|24,192|28,711|28,888|27,035|25,817|51,687|56,907| |\n|Total cost (excluding interest & depreciation)|56,656|70,166|77,969|85,655|90,588|106,957|114,840|118,849|117,631|138,697|124,336|127,522|\n|Profitability| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|EBITDA (before other income)|25,402|25,809|28,437|32,311|34,513|41,563|42,248|43,760|44,978|30,300|32,344|37,163|\n|Profit before tax|19,164|19,852|21,912|26,289|25,826|31,472|32,340|32,430|33,388|30,485|66,712|90,058|\n|Profit after tax attributable to shareholders of the Company|48,999|50,439|52,499|86,017|84,937|89,071|83,751|86,063|87,014|65,959|115.19| |\n|Financial Position| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|Equity share capital|13,162|16,624|16,624|20,891|22,720|24,522|26,444|28,658|28,658|30,300|32,344|37,163|\n|Reserves and surplus|27,227|28,495|30,726|32,311|34,513|41,563|42,248|43,760|44,978|30,485|66,712|90,058|\n|Gross block of property, plant and equipment|300,464|319,656|319,656|353,843|387,223|394,998|424,285|448,464|488,649|488,649|592,195|614,795|\n|Total investments| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|Net current assets| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|Earnings per share in| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|EPS -

Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.\n\nBoard effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serve as independent directors on the Boards of more than three listed entities.\n\nTCS\u2019 governance philosophy around minority shareholders\u2019 interests is guided by the TCoC which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further, a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders\u2019 interests are protected.\n\nTCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosure and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with management or the Board.\n\nShareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary\u2019s office through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholder Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.\n\n# Avoidance of conflict of interest\n\nChairmanship of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).\n\nThe TCoC for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee \u2013 including the executive directors \u2013 from accepting any position of responsibility with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS\u2019 prior written approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.\n\n# Values, Ethics and compliance\n\nOver the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company\u2019s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual, Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.\n\nThe TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees\u2019 freedom of association, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.\n\nEvery employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership reiterate the importance of the company values and the TCoC.\n\nCustomers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.\n\nEmployees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix \u2013 the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land to senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistleblower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.\n\n3 GRI 2-15\n\n4 GRI 2-11\n\n5 https://www.tcs.com/tata-code-of-conduct\n\n6 GRI 2-12\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Corporate Governance Report | 114", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4010, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afdd9f3f-71aa-4047-a53c-75db91a20962": {"__data__": {"id_": "afdd9f3f-71aa-4047-a53c-75db91a20962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "884f6e18-17bf-4913-bcc1-f12d6fb9e9d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ea2d67bb1e4927cb2f17acdbb30293fe7721c037e8431f49547d948a68ed2f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Material Topic\n\n# TCS\u2019 Approach\n\nCompliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations. Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the Chief HR Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director (COO and ED), and CEO and MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations.\n\n# Tax Strategy\n\nTCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner. TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose of gaining tax advantages. TCS\u2019s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion itself or by its employees or vendors. TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.\n\n# Board Oversight of Sustainability Matters\n\nTCS\u2019 approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:\n\n|Material Sustainability Topics|Board Committee|\n|---|---|\n|Financial reporting, robustness of internal controls and risk management systems, auditor remuneration, compliance to policies around insider trading, whistle blower, ethics and TCoC.|Audit Committee|\n|Risk management policy and plan, management of foreign exchange risks, cyber security risks, data privacy risks and intellectual property infringement risks.|Risk Management Committee|\n|Recommend composition of Board and its committees, appointment/re-appointment of directors and KMP, design executive directors\u2019 remuneration, recommend remuneration policy for directors, executive team and KMP, evaluation of the performance of the Board, Committees and Directors.|Nomination and Remuneration Committee|\n|Health and safety at the workplace, shareholder grievances and other sustainability initiatives.|Stakeholders\u2019 Relationship Committee|\n|Community initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility, including compliances.|Corporate Social Responsibility Committee|\n\n# Succession planning\n\nTCS\u2019 philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and an organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three business groups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and Business Transformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units. Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.\n\n7GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3.

That includes principles of protecting and safeguarding human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the abolition of forced and compulsory labor, child labor in the supply chain and strong corporate governance practices including anti-corruption and promoting fair business practices across the supply chain. TCoC also requires its suppliers to protect the environment and make conscious use of scarce natural resources in their business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of health and safety in the workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices in letter and spirit in turn for its employees.\n\nThe Company supports the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Women account for 65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized communities. To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the Government of India\u2019s efforts to improve literacy. LaaS provides an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT with the theory of cognition and laws of perception. LaaS adopts creative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.\n\nModules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10 hours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen entitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages \u2013 nine Indian and three foreign.\n\n# Case Study: LaaS\n\nPyari Ben resides in the Bijori hamlet of Puwasa village, in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Alirajpur district, one of the least literate and poorest districts in the country. Due to limited local employment prospects, villagers from Alirajpur travel for work to nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an exception in this regard. She never had the opportunity to attend school, so she never achieved literacy. This became difficult because she couldn\u2019t keep track of her hard-earned daily income as a construction worker. She gained basic literacy skills after joining the Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program, which made her realize that her contractor used to defraud her by not paying her the proper wages. LaaS gave her the awareness she needed to fight for her rights and ultimately get her dues. She can now calculate her working hours and daily pay, create a budget, and save money.\n\nShe created a bank account and enrolled in Ayushman Bharat, a health insurance scheme, to obtain medical benefits for herself and her family. As a migrant who travels from her village to distant work locations, she can now read and recognize train numbers to board the correct train. Pyari inspired other women in the village and encouraged them to participate in this program.\n\n# Ignite My Future (IMF)\n\nIgnite My Future is a teacher professional development program which introduces the concept of computational thinking into all core subjects. This is a transdisciplinary education program that transforms the way students learn. IMF has generated a great impact through professional development offerings, special projects as well as volunteer and customer engagements with the partnered schools. IMF\u2019s Learning Leaders community supports the growing global community of partnered educators, committed to learnings about the power of computational thinking.

This year, IMF India has launched its Season 1 of GIP, where students were asked to explore accessible and adaptive tools, identify and problem-solve community level issues that are limiting the accessibility and inclusivity of all the learners. It uses a four-pronged model of (1) volunteer-driven engagements, in-person or virtually, (2) seamless year-round connects via goIT Online, (3) SDG-focused monthly challenges and (4) Work experience designed to introduce students to local experts and opportunities.\n\nTeachers and students from schools like School of Scholars (Maharashtra), BGS Schools (Karnataka), Podar International School (Maharashtra), Rajya Ashram Paddhati Vidyalaya (Samaj Kalyan Department, Uttar Pradesh), APSWREIS (Andhra Pradesh) in India have collaborated with schools from North America in this experiential journey. Overall, the participants from India worked on 109 innovation projects, clocking over 560 collaborative learning hours and 268 videos over Microsoft Flip tool. Teachers were very appreciative of the opportunity to learn and collaborate with educators around the world.\n\nIn FY 2023, IMF benefited more than 293,000 students and educators across North America, India, UK and Ireland, APAC and ANZ. After over a decade of success and a footprint across 42 countries, goIT has benefited over 144,000 students who have designed more than 29,000 tech-for-good digital innovation prototypes. Over 41,000 students and educators have benefited from this program in FY 2023 globally.\n\n# goIT Case Study\n\nSpeaking about her experience at the first inaugural TCS goIT program in Saudi Arabia, Leah, a Grade 7 student, said, \u201cI am super happy to have had the opportunity to get involved in the design thinking program. The mobile app training is cool, and I am proud of my project on improving world health by using technology.\u201d The event was celebrated with more than 100 learners from the Al Sahafa International School, Riyadh. Under the theme of UN SDG, students ideated solutions for good health and wellbeing, affordable and clean energy, and zero hunger.\n\nGrade 7 students prototyped a mobile solution called \u2018Team Earth\u2019 which displays the location of the nearest renewable energy outlets and finds an environmental, social, and governance volunteer. Meanwhile, Grade 5 students pitched a technology solution to solve world hunger by creating an app called \u2018Free Supermarket\u2019 which would help people make and receive donations.\n\nExcited to see the STEM exposure students received through the TCS goIT program, the Academic Coordinator of Al Sahafa International School, Ola Mourad said, \u201cPrograms like this are extremely important in showing students how they can succeed in a range of fields, with a good grounding in IT.\u201d\n\n# IMF Case Study\n\nThis year, Ignite My Future made its impact through professional development, volunteer and customer engagement and special projects. One such collaboration was with the Meghe Group of Schools to encourage students for an interest in STEM and computational thinking. The purpose of education is best served when students are doing something that would not only improve their competencies but also create positive social impact. Global innovation project is one such opportunity I believe, because students are not only reflecting upon what they have learnt but are also getting step closer towards sustainable development goals. I am glad and proud of all the efforts that students and teachers have put in, also that they have consciously chosen to be a part of this project in identifying how can they improve accessibility not only around them but also pick up global perspectives around it. I am sure that the seeds of efforts that we are putting in most our students today, will give us citizens of tomorrow who would have SDGs as inherent part of their lives.

Opportunities for employees to volunteer time include skills-based volunteering, pro bono support to community-based organization and social cause leadership. TCS community investments have been actualized, in a large part, by its large employee base who generously volunteer their time, skills and expertise as last-mile connectors.\n\nIn FY 2023, TCS launched the civic movement #millionhoursofpurpose, a collaborative effort by TCSers to volunteer a million hours of purpose in a quarter which celebrates a positive impact for the people, by the people. The initiative encourages employees to support in different causes, be it an employee\u2019s own initiative, a TCS community program, a TATA engagement or one with its customers. Through Q4, TCSers far exceeded the pledge of a #millionhoursofpurpose, by volunteering over 2 million hours in this initiative.\n\n# HOPE Case Study\n\nWhen you find your why, you don\u2019t hit snooze anymore!

Their reasons were different and reflected their life experiences. Some signed on to a 9-day deployment to give back to the community the help they had received during a natural disaster. Others had served previously with the military or a service organization and wanted to use that experience to help.\n\nThis helps those organizations extend their support to more local and global beneficiaries, demonstrating the force multiplier effect that technology can play. Millions of dollars of \u2018social value\u2019 have been generated by this program since its inception.\n\n# International Medical Corps (IMC) Case Study\n\nA first responder, International Medical Corps (IMC) provides emergency relief to those struck by conflict, disaster, and disease. IMC approached TCS seeking help in digitizing their vendor pre-qualification platform, a critical component of the procurement workflow. IMC does not procure supplies from a vendor who has not completed the qualification process or whose qualification has lapsed, which can lead to a shortage of critical supplies that IMC beneficiaries depend on.\n\nThe process was arduous and complicated with a high margin for potential error. After in-depth research seeking to gain a comprehensive understanding of IMC\u2019s vendor pre-qualification system, TCS redesigned and enhanced the existing system by placing it in a digital platform that is more transparent and accessible for IMC\u2019s team. The system offers IMC a structured workflow for maintaining vendor information, tracking critical vendor qualification status, and ensuring the organization has on-demand and concurrent access to vital information throughout the vendor database.\n\n# Business with Purpose\n\nBusiness with Purpose is a distinctive framework that enables \u2018Purpose Partnerships\u2019 with like-minded organizations to advance access, equity and inclusion around the world.\n\nThe Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility | 142", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d7d8ea3-d2fc-4424-906c-23ad080d375d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d7d8ea3-d2fc-4424-906c-23ad080d375d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad9e9664-2496-41c0-8861-6c50180ee4c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "437135582d9b0b6b0dc7fb9e8b6687bf1dabe575cda14fa40ef7ee8729cc5462", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The company leverages its industry and social responsibility.

Hazard and risk identification is carried out by the process owners in consultation with the safety experts. The process owners are responsible to ensure adequate controls are identified and implemented to control the identified risks. Mitigation plans and controls are provided to eliminate the identified hazards and risks.\n\n# b. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove them? (Y/N)\n\nYes. TCS has a safety incident reporting and management process to ensure that all work-related incidents (which include accidents, near-misses, unsafe conditions, and unsafe acts) are reported and closed after taking necessary corrective actions. This is enabled through an online safety incident reporting tool which is accessible to all TCS employees for transparent reporting. The platform also supports incident investigation and corrective action with the perspective of eliminating hazards and preventing incidents. The awareness to employees on incident reporting is created during mandatory OHS web-based training (WBT) and communication through mailers during monthly themes on incidents. The action owners are also sensitized on the importance of taking corrective action within given timelines with the perspective of eliminating hazards and ensuring the mitigation plan is implemented. TCSers can also report their health and safety related issues or concerns through an internal administration helpline; these issues are resolved by the concerned action owner within prescribed timelines. They can also email their concerns to the Corporate HSE email ID and communicate with local health and safety teams.\n\n# c. Do the employees of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?\n\nYes. TCS recognizes that overall physical and mental wellbeing of its employees is integral to its success and growth aspirations. TCS has taken a holistic approach to well-being to cover mental health, ergonomic health, physical safety at home, delivered through digital channels, hospital insurance services, occupational health services, and seamless integration of all stakeholders. TCS has occupational health centers (OHC) at TCS facilities in India. The employees and contractors at these facilities have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services as well. During the year, TCS facilitated several virtual consultations with physiotherapists, gynecologists, nutritionists, gastroenterologists with whom employees can schedule appointments and avail the services. These consulting services have helped employees to a large extent in their return to the offices after the pandemic. Beyond the OHCs, TCS provides comprehensive medical and healthcare services to employees through the company\u2019s medical insurance to employees and their dependents. In overseas geographies, non-occupational medical and healthcare services are provided as per the country regulations. To enable physical fitness, TCS has recreational facilities and gymnasiums at many of its facilities; it organized activities such as online sessions, sun salutation challenges, and personalized yoga training; continued to run the Fit4Life program with daily workout sessions, walking, and running challenges.\n\n# d. Mental well-being initiatives\n\nTCS, through its TCS Cares initiative, instituted programs for employees and their families to cope with mental stress and anxiety. Online counselling sessions and self-help resources help employees face distress levels through empathetic support by HR, managers, and peers. Emotional well-being (EWB) leaves are available to employees who need it. With many employees returning to work during the year, the \u2018Return to office\u2019 transition included multiple training and sensitization programs for HRs, managers, and employees. TCS Cares mental health web-based training (WBT) was completed by many employees during the year. Also, several leaders completed the Leadership Program. Global mental health month was observed in October where two major events on \u2018Resilience\u2019 were carried out through #OneTCS events.\n\n55 GRI 403-2\n\n56 GRI 403-2\n\n57 GRI 403-6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5100, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1637746f-8a27-4d27-8a11-feb6da60aadc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1637746f-8a27-4d27-8a11-feb6da60aadc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ed3727a-b0e8-453f-80b1-6b33dba0c1d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6542bff2f3b80fdbc3f30383a2d1af7cac33672c70ed3251904e86c679f6beb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# 11.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place\n\nTCS recognizes that occupational, health and safety (OHS) and overall physical and mental wellbeing of its employees are critical to its success and growth aspirations as spelled out in its OHS Policy. TCS is committed to provide safe workplaces for preventing injuries, illnesses, and continuously strives to eliminate hazards and reduce OHS risks.\n\nThere are no major health and safety (H&S) risks associated with TCS\u2019 services as the company provides customized solutions and IT services. Key workplace safety risks include fire safety in buildings, office safety risks such as slips and electrical safety (e.g., electric shock) from use of office equipment and road safety risks during commutes in company provided vehicles. Key occupational health related risks are associated with workplace ergonomics, indoor air quality, illumination and noise. Hazard identification and risk assessment process is conducted to identify each such risk and proper mitigation measures are put in place to create a healthy and safe work environment.\n\nSome of the mitigation measures to prevent or mitigate significant occupational health & safety impacts include:\n\n- Provision and maintenance of fire detection, alarm and suppression systems.\n- Regular site review, inspections and audits to assess safety preparedness.\n- Regular mock drills for fire as well as medical emergencies.\n- Provision of ergonomically designed chairs and workstations to prevent musculoskeletal disorders (MSD\u2019s) and computer monitors for better visual health.\n- Digital monitoring of indoor air quality and periodic cleaning of the HVAC ducts to avoid sick building syndrome.\n- Regular training on occupational health & safety training to sensitize employees on OHS aspects to inculcate a safety culture.\n- Employee engagement campaigns on health & safety topics such as fire safety, road safety, emergency evacuation, ergonomics among others.\n\n# 13.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption.\n\n# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n1.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d).\n\n# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Management\u2019s and Board of Directors\u2019 Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls\n\nThe respective Company\u2019s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on the criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n# Auditor\u2019s Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit.

The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company\u2019s equity share capital. The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.\n\n# 2) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (referred to as \u201cInd AS\u201d) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.\n\n# 3) Basis of preparation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group\u2019s normal operating cycle.\n\nBased on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\n\nThe statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.\n\nThe functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\n# 4) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it. The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity\u2019s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.\n\nEntities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nChanges in the Company\u2019s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Company\u2019s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.\n\nAssets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5336, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1303cdf5-20a1-44da-85a1-1ac2a1cda5b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1303cdf5-20a1-44da-85a1-1ac2a1cda5b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f0d9eff-4652-4a3b-917d-387ee6644ea2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bbb9629b0f77095268d78f8f3c504d68d6c9aac3e2f8c6b0c35da160e7e593e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nExchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n# 5) Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.\n\nThe Group uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n\n# (a) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\n\n# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.\n\n# (c) Impairment of goodwill\n\nThe Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies.\n\n# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets.\n\n# (e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\n\n# (f) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# (g) Employee benefits\n\nThe accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\n\n# (h) Leases\n\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 197", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5028, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15879813-907b-4987-874e-152b52cb6ef9": {"__data__": {"id_": "15879813-907b-4987-874e-152b52cb6ef9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ddad61a-a34e-4c58-8a6c-0f6a9b2e00b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50f64fe5ab3da84b390d088cccd027af0a5ccbc8c6b2ca10966ed42467e5217a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nif the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.\n\nThe discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n\n# 6) Recent pronouncements\n\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs (\u201cMCA\u201d) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:\n\n# Ind AS 1 \u2013 Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThe amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n# Ind AS 12 \u2013 Income Taxes\n\nThe amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.\n\n# Ind AS 8 \u2013 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nThe amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are \u201cmonetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty\u201d. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.\n\n# 7) Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nPurchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.\n\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests\u2019 proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests\u2019 share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\n\nBusiness combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted at historical cost. The difference between any consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\n# 8) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group\u2019s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 198", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5482, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77027e6e-effc-4d68-8bc6-27ae36d4276b": {"__data__": {"id_": "77027e6e-effc-4d68-8bc6-27ae36d4276b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c3f65c43-47ae-41bb-9eef-ae4187176f29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4637c70519c65c1afeefb20a89b4acf008318c84bed96b7bf57d299aed676a2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n\n# Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets. The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.\n\n# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\n# Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n# Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.

These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\n# Instruments not in hedging relationship\n\nThe Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)\n\nThe Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group uses a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n# (a) Investments\n\nInvestments consist of the following:\n\n# Investments \u2013 Non-current\n\n|(` crore)|As at March 31, 2023|As at March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Investments designated at fair value through OCI| | |\n|Fully paid equity shares (unquoted)| | |\n|Mozido LLC|82|76|\n|FCM LLC|62|57|\n|Taj Air Limited|19|19|\n|Philippine Dealing System Holdings Corporation|7|7|\n|Less: Impairment in value of investments|(134)|(123)|\n|Investments carried at amortised cost| | |\n|Government bonds and securities (quoted)|188|187|\n|Corporate bonds (quoted)|42|-|\n| |266|223|\n\nInvestments \u2013 Non-current includes `229 crore and `187 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, pertaining to held for specified purposes.\n\n# Investments -

For leases with similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specified or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of measurement in statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n# Group as a lessor\n\nAt the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of the lessor\u2019s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset of the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\n# The details of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:\n\n| |Additions for the year ended March 31, 2023|Net carrying amount as at March 31, 2023|\n|---|---|---|\n|Leasehold land|179|940|\n|Buildings|1,236|6,330|\n|Leasehold improvements|14|30|\n|Computer equipment|73|125|\n|Software licences|-|96|\n|Vehicles|17|34|\n|Office equipment|1|5|\n|Total|1,520|7,560|\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 215", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4368, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24fe5493-8fb2-4638-a955-51833d66f512": {"__data__": {"id_": "24fe5493-8fb2-4638-a955-51833d66f512", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15f4ffc5-8188-4d4c-852c-ee0f985dfb3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4e6d6045524ea1527ef7865c06b10886a48c6ee120f2669b54b0fa827569480", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n| |Additions for the year ended March 31, 2022|Net carrying amount as at March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Leasehold land|100|774|\n|Buildings|1,357|6,586|\n|Leasehold improvements|-|23|\n|Computer equipment|4|81|\n|Software licences|145|133|\n|Vehicles|16|32|\n|Office equipment|2|7|\n|Total|Total|7,636|\n\n# Depreciation on right-of-use assets is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Leasehold land|10|9|\n|Buildings|1,530|1,465|\n|Leasehold improvements|6|6|\n|Computer equipment|32|23|\n|Software licences|37|38|\n|Vehicles|16|16|\n|Office equipment|3|3|\n|Total|Total|1,560|\n\nInterest on lease liabilities is `492 crore and `519 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Group incurred `318 crore and `277 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases is `2,538 crore and `2,228 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, including cash outflow for short term and low value leases.\n\nThe Group has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.

The Group offers a\nled, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.\n\nRevenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects\nconsideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\n\n- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, expenses\nexpended, number of transactions processed, etc.\n- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to\nprovide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.\n- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (\u2018POC\u2019)\naccounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The\ncosts used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.\n- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software\nis recognised upfront at the point in time when the system/software is delivered to the customer. In cases where\nimplementation and/or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these\nand software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC.\n- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred\nto the customer.\n- The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue\nfrom the supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting\nas a principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when\nacting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service\ncredits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer.\nIt also excludes taxes collected from customers.\n\nThe Group\u2019s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.\nThe Group assesses the products/services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the\ncontract.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3355, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff77cd0f-883e-467b-8cd3-08f95b418a09": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff77cd0f-883e-467b-8cd3-08f95b418a09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "323372bf-0ee3-44ad-aad3-658201ea0b64", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f682e2d0e4042eb4aa6c96d7fbc71d89e55c345ff7117d2e181b0cc406a51051", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIdentification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability to benefit independently from such deliverables.\n\nJudgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions, incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable consideration to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more performance obligations.\n\nThe Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer.\n\nContract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The application of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n\nContract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are recognised as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only time is required, as per contractual terms.\n\nUnearned and deferred revenue (\u201ccontract liability\u201d) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues. The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and/or milestone based payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\n\nContracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group accounts for modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\n\nThe Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography. Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\n\n|(` crore)|Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Consultancy services|2,23,332|1,90,289|\n|Sale of equipment and software licences|2,126|1,465|\n|Total|2,25,458|1,91,754|\n\nRevenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note). While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognition corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 225", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4738, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2198bc13-fa94-41d0-af59-31fe5c553944": {"__data__": {"id_": "2198bc13-fa94-41d0-af59-31fe5c553944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adc74ec0-6c2f-4336-8bf3-a7fc8979b53b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d68ef2b55c6e7affcec37d19de9bd2bb61b9d8944aac6a5cbeee56c55d846d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nUnsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, etc.).

The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the income tax liability of the Company\u2019s worldwide income.\n\nThe current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to entities in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.\n\nAdvance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the liability on a net basis.\n\nDeferred income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3048, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e83a6ca0-ccc8-47e9-90bb-951d25fc3221": {"__data__": {"id_": "e83a6ca0-ccc8-47e9-90bb-951d25fc3221", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b832273c-747c-4e18-8c58-68a39e5b0585", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1e9d8421e1c36a8ef8a925a86384c91c9a2ab89eba7ef1cb53ab2397242a1c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be realised.

For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that will arise when the tax holiday ends.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent that it is available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with it will be realised.\n\n# The income tax expense consists of the following:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Current tax| | |\n|Current tax expense for current year|15,389|14,333|\n|Current tax benefit pertaining to prior years|(632)|(679)|\n| |14,757|13,654|\n|Deferred tax| | |\n|Deferred tax benefit for current year|(130)|(333)|\n|Deferred tax benefit pertaining to prior years|(23)|(83)|\n| |(153)|(416)|\n| |14,604|13,238|\n\n# The reconciliation of estimated income tax expense at Indian statutory income tax rate to income tax expense reported in the consolidated statement of profit and loss is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Profit before tax|56,907|51,687|\n|Indian statutory income tax rate|34.94%|34.94%|\n|Expected income tax expense|19,887|18,062|\n|Tax effect of adjustments to reconcile expected income tax expense to reported income tax expense| | |\n|Tax holidays|(5,112)|(4,792)|\n|Income exempt from tax|(236)|(396)|\n|Undistributed earnings in branches and subsidiaries|276|(47)|\n|Tax on income at different rates|508|980|\n|Tax pertaining to prior years|(655)|(762)|\n|Others (net)|(64)|193|\n|Total income tax expense|14,604|13,238|", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2974, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7263188e-99a5-4b35-b01e-461862f9e2c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7263188e-99a5-4b35-b01e-461862f9e2c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2e19908-0557-43a1-9e79-b1a1be08de22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b56ee51201170ac86f7d9335d29cac6ae445660353d41c31a52d8d7c93e66e1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nTata Consultancy Services Limited benefits from the tax holiday available for units set up under the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) scheme, which commenced on April 1, 2005.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report.

A company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.\n\n# Management\u2019s and Board of Directors\u2019 Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls\n\nThe Company\u2019s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n# Auditors\u2019 Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness.\n\nFor B S R & Co.

The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company\u2019s equity share capital. The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.\n\n# 2) Statement of compliance\n\nThese standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as \u201cInd AS\u201d) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.\n\n# 3) Basis of preparation\n\nThese standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company\u2019s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.\n\n# 4) Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.\n\n# (a) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\n\n# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.\n\n# (c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4694, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75eb056d-7c36-406a-9f4c-9c6c56918215": {"__data__": {"id_": "75eb056d-7c36-406a-9f4c-9c6c56918215", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e905a884-3839-4f8d-838c-3cc0782727d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05399506be58d5f4f73f53271478ef942e4380a5bd1c79744026646d1c72f581", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\n\nFair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\n\n# (e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n\nThe Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\n\n# (f) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.\n\n# (g) Employee benefits\n\nThe accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\n\n# (h) Leases\n\nThe Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\n# 5) Recent pronouncements\n\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs (\u201cMCA\u201d) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:\n\n- Ind AS 1 \u2013 Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n- Ind AS 12 \u2013 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.\n- Ind AS 8 \u2013 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are \u201cmonetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty\u201d. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53cddcd5-6845-45dc-9f7e-552827fcb48a": {"__data__": {"id_": "53cddcd5-6845-45dc-9f7e-552827fcb48a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "450d8cdb-0502-41c3-83ad-b5b28b75a714", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "85a2b3ca0371ec653792887acaaefbbd39db3bef859e39c6209de5025cac03e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\n\nmeasurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\n# 6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\n\n# Investment in subsidiaries\n\nInvestment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.\n\n# Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n# Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\n\n# Derivative accounting\n\n\u2022 Instruments in hedging relationship\n\nThe Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.\n\nThe hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.\n\nThe effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\n\nThe Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option.

Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n# Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.\n\n# Instruments not in hedging relationship\n\nThe Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23\n\nStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 269", "mimetype":

Considering the countries and environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.\n\nThe Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange rate risks. Any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company\u2019s revenue in international business.\n\nThe Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks and hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies. The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.

Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deteriorating creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and credit customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.\n\nFinancial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Cash deposits include an amount of `2,428 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which is individually more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.\n\n# \u2022 Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount for any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining adjustment in re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n# Company as a lessor\n\nAt the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor\u2019s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the underlying asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\n\n- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, expenses incurred, number of transactions processed, etc.\n- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.\n- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (\u2018POC\u2019) accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.\n- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system/software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and/or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC basis.\n- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\n- The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue from the supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as a principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. It also excludes taxes collected from customers.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 294", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3232, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f132e3c-123b-4a3f-9b44-88a1486a15cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f132e3c-123b-4a3f-9b44-88a1486a15cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b986c93-daca-403f-8e31-4f90d20113d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2162e0060b8a74376685403d26318e2e94ed34ef6adfcfde9dfc41bc919762a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the products/services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\n\nJudgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions, and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable consideration to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more performance obligations.\n\nThe Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how the customer consumes benefits as services are rendered, whether the customer controls the asset as it is being created or the existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and acceptance of delivery by the customer, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer.\n\nRevenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm\u2019s length. Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of the licence, whichever is less. The application of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n\nContract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are recognised as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is an unconditional right to receive cash, and only time is required, as per contractual terms. Unearned and deferred revenue (\u201ccontract liability\u201d) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues. The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based payments and/or milestone-based payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of fulfilling obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company accounts for modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\n\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography. Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Consultancy services|1,88,748|1,59,106|\n|Sale of equipment and software licences|1,606|1,235|\n| |1,90,354|1,60,341|\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 295", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4398, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4df6d79-e179-46b7-8757-59ecf4216a6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4df6d79-e179-46b7-8757-59ecf4216a6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "754d1b0d-2179-40e9-850e-d2fade5b7bcf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f6722b0d8ff31e0784f562cf17986ecda64eb7759b5def9fc64d482f4acf90f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\n\n# Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Banking, Financial Services and Insurance|68,240|58,614|\n|Manufacturing|16,905|14,576|\n|Retail and Consumer Business|33,169|26,966|\n|Communication, Media and Technology|33,606|28,778|\n|Life Sciences and Healthcare|22,398|18,341|\n|Others|16,036|13,066|\n|Total|1,90,354|1,60,341|\n\n# Revenue disaggregation by geography is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Americas| | |\n|North America|1,13,208|90,630|\n|Latin America|382|314|\n|Europe| | |\n|United Kingdom|30,676|27,595|\n|Continental Europe|19,209|17,595|\n|Asia Pacific|12,017|11,178|\n|India|10,941|9,547|\n|Middle East and Africa|3,921|3,482|\n|Total|1,90,354|1,60,341|\n\nGeographical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.\n\n# Information about major customers\n\nNo single customer represents 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.\n\nWhile disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenue, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115.

Accordingly, MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.\n\n# The income tax expense consists of the following:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Current tax| | |\n|Current tax expense for current year|13,623|12,912|\n|Current tax benefit pertaining to prior years|(677)|(981)|\n| |12,946|11,931|\n|Deferred tax| | |\n|Deferred tax benefit for current year|(362)|(395)|\n|Deferred tax benefit pertaining to prior years|-|-|\n| |(362)|(395)|\n| |12,584|11,536|\n\n# The reconciliation of estimated income tax expense at statutory income tax rate to income tax expense reported in profit and loss is as follows:\n\n| |Year ended March 31, 2023|Year ended March 31, 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|Profit before taxes|51,690|49,723|\n|Indian statutory income tax rate|34.94%|34.94%|\n|Expected income tax expense|18,063|17,375|\n|Tax effect of adjustments to reconcile expected income tax expense to reported income tax expense| | |\n|Tax holidays|(5,097)|(4,604)|\n|Income exempt from tax|(736)|(1,240)|\n|Undistributed earnings in branches|58|(232)|\n|Tax on income at different rates|963|1,107|\n|Tax pertaining to prior years|(677)|(981)|\n|Others (net)|10|111|\n|Total income tax expense|12,584|11,536|", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2811, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b810afc-1c2f-4ea2-b974-b235e4b0d27e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b810afc-1c2f-4ea2-b974-b235e4b0d27e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46ee541f-bc77-4a93-ae88-2687355b87e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b10b3c484ab9f4f6ba642bd9700bb677a5e6db5dbfd8002db8ed9830346afb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company benefits from the tax holiday available for units set up under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.

TCS discloses its performance against various environmental parameters as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, which is a part of this Integrated Annual Report.\n\n# Emerging regulation\n\nEmerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity tariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which impact TCS. Regulations around procurement of renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company\u2019s climate change mitigation plan, is also evolving in all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes.\n\n# Technology\n\nWith more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping offices eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and works on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operational risks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient. Additionally, TCS is one of the market leaders in the cloud migration opportunity, helping clients migrate their workloads from owned data centers to hyperscaler clouds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with those workloads.\n\n# Legal\n\nTCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management) on a periodic basis and has a robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with legal requirements of current, amended, and new regulations.\n\n# Market\n\nClimate change is driving a lot of changes in TCS\u2019 customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and opportunities, giving the company an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.\n\n# Reputation\n\nReputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to protect TCS\u2019 reputation.\n\n# Acute physical\n\nAcute physical risks associated with extreme weather events are relevant as TCS has substantial operations in coastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation and cyclones. For example, the company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, and Kolkata are exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.\n\n# Chronic physical\n\nHaving presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation patterns, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, TCS\u2019s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, and Kolkata makes it vulnerable to rise in sea level and impacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from the perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure.\n\nTCFD Strategy A, B and C.

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nAlthough we considered the effectiveness of management\u2019s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls.

enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the integrated report and related information and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.\n\n# Our procedures included:\n\n- Conducted interviews with select personnel at sites and corporate teams to understand the process for collecting, collating and reporting the subject matter as per Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

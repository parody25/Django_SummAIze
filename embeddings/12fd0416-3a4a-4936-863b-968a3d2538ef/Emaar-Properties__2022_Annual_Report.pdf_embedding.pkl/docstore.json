More than 57% of our customers in Dubai are residents\u2014and international markets continued to be strong.\n\nA new, post-pandemic world is upon us, where the way we live, work, and play has been permanently altered. Adapting to such changes calls for reimagining spaces with flexibility and wellness at their core. Our record sales of residences, high occupancy at our offices, hotels and malls, and a robust pipeline of highly anticipated projects testify to the attractiveness of our properties to our customers and investors alike, at home and abroad.\n\nIt also reflects their confidence in Dubai\u2019s future. Emerging quickly from the pandemic, Dubai has strengthened its credentials as a world-class city that offers safety, high quality of life and good governance, prompting people from across the world to align their aspirations with the nation\u2019s ambitions. Thanks to the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and progressive government policies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is looking forward to an exciting tomorrow.\n\n# 2023: The year of sustainability\n\nThe UAE has undertaken extensive efforts in recent years towards driving sustainability in the country under the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, and in alignment with the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, UAE President, has recently declared 2023 as the year of sustainability, to promote innovation so that relevant and need-focused solutions can be found that help to bridge the transition between the conventional and a more sustainability-oriented society. As one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing cities, Dubai has the responsibility to champion sustainability, which is one of the priorities for 2023 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai.\n\n# Reinforcing commitment\n\nWe remain committed to bringing luxury living to the world\u2014defining high standards, and delighting customers with more than they desire. Our strategy of masterplan-led development and the unique mix of comfort, convenience, glamour, and entertainment that we offer is a blueprint for our international markets too. Across the regions where we are extending our presence, we are developing iconic properties that empower people to shop, eat, work, play and live in new ways. By blending great locations, excellent design, innovative technology and imaginative thinking, we hope to bring luxury living to more and more people.\n\n# Delivering strong performance\n\nThe efforts made by the government to diversify the UAE economy and enable Dubai to be a business-friendly city through progressive and pragmatic legislation make it easier for us to stretch the boundaries of possibilities and welcome enterprise to our shores. The UAE economy grew by 6.5% in 2022 thanks to a strong comeback in travel and tourism, business, retail, construction, and activities related to the Expo 2020 Dubai. Oil production also went up.\n\nIt was also an excellent year for the real estate market in the UAE, with sales and income reaching multi-year highs in many areas. A stable cost environment meant easing supply-side pressures, leading to faster execution and benefiting from both the macro tailwinds and strong demand for real estate, and reaping the fruits of the strategic measures put in place during the pandemic. We achieved property sales of AED 35.1 Bn.\n\nOur balance sheet strength, robust cash flows and profitability, impeccable execution track record, and future-forward ideas will enable us to successfully navigate any headwinds that may arise.\n\n# Building future-ready Emaar\n\nEmaar, as the largest integrated developer in the region and one of the largest globally, has been completely aligned with the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan which maps out a comprehensive plan for a sustainable urban development in Dubai. It focuses on enhancing people\u2019s happiness and quality of life and reinforcing Dubai as a global destination for citizens, residents and visitors over the next 20 years. With an aim to make UAE one of the world\u2019s best countries with sustainability conundrum, we have taken specific measures, such as eradicating single-use plastics and moving to biodegradable items in our hospitality chains. From our restaurants to our guest rooms and conference venues, all have been rendered plastic-free, leading to a substantial reduction in waste to landfills.\n\n# Note of gratitude\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners for your unwavering support. We are also thankful to our Board of Directors for their invaluable guidance and wise counsel.\n\nJamal Bin Theniyah\n\nChairman\n\nEMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4974, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d44d835b-b95b-401c-bae0-157cb85520dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d44d835b-b95b-401c-bae0-157cb85520dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f752f23f-bfc6-4753-9566-82cbc4ea2b02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75e46f3d1a305840062ab9b85edb3c01f3472cb8827ccc509d6653620b9f03d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09792110-8c55-4dd8-bad7-79d6f6321d56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0319d1073834f14d9f22e68701bbec45c8fff8bf5b7d2dc905547551bfd97da5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR\n\n# ONWARD TO NEWER HORIZONS\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nIf the previous two years were an indication of how resilient and well established our organisation is, then this year is all about affirmation and fresh starts. Now that the challenges of the pandemic are firmly behind us, we are witnessing the financial fruits of a robust recovery. There is widespread assurance and a sense of urgency to get things done. As in the years of the pandemic, our Rulers and the Dubai Government have been our guiding light, stimulating economic vitality through investment-friendly schemes, the most recent being the Golden Visa programme. With Dubai\u2019s commercial, trade, logistics, and tourism activities swiftly resuming to normalcy and its ambitious \u2018D33\u2019 agenda, the city\u2019s growth story remains as alluring and enduring as ever.\n\n# Strong financial performance\n\nOur record performance this year bears out Dubai\u2019s continuing appeal to the millions who visit our city and professionals who choose to stay and build their lives here. Emaar continues to be the first choice among customers, which reflects in the Company\u2019s performance. This year, our newly launched projects have done exceedingly well with 98% of the units launched already sold, aggregating a Year-on-Year (YoY) increase in sales of 12%. Consolidating the high-growth trend, this year Emaar Properties PJSC has reported group property sales of AED 35.1 Bn, revenues of AED 24.9 Bn and a net profit attributable to owners of AED 6.8 Bn. Recurring revenue operations continued to stay robust, comprising 36% of total revenues, while recurring EBITDA contribution has reached 53% of total EBITDA. Our property sales backlog of AED 53.2 Bn signals a very healthy financial position and secures our near-term prospects.\n\n# Significant transactions and strategic development\n\nIn the post-pandemic phase, Dubai has witnessed high international traveller footfalls and received the highest international tourist spending at US$ 29.4 Bn. This resurgence in the tourism sector is reflected in our hospitality revenues, which have grown by 25% YoY, while our Malls business recorded 8% YoY growth. Emaar\u2019s transformational growth agenda has advanced with scale and speed over the last year, owing to a number of significant transactions and strategic development projects that have laid the groundwork for the company\u2019s accelerated execution of the said agenda, which includes substantial geographic and sector expansion across the platform.\n\n# Emaar Development\n\nOur build-to-sell property development business achieved property sales at AED 30.7 Bn, marking an increase of 12% compared to 2021. Led by the resilience of the Dubai property market, we delivered 6,100 units in 2022 and ~9,000 units are in pipeline for delivery in 2023. Net profit attributable to owners of Emaar Development rose 17% to touch AED 3.8 Bn. Open spaces and waterfront locations remain the most preferred, with apartment sales accounting for the lion\u2019s share.\n\n# Emaar Mall Management\n\nRevenues from our Malls business saw a healthy increase of 8% on the back of Dubai emerging as a leading tourism destination. This was reflected in tenant sales growing by 40% vis-\u00e0-vis pre-pandemic levels. Even our latest entrant Dubai Hills Mall, a large regional shopping format launched in February 2022, achieved 91% occupancy within a mere span of 10 months from its launch. Our mixed retail format portfolio enables us to strategically position super regional, regional, specialty and community-integrated retail to meet a wide range of shopping and consumption needs. We have one of the industry\u2019s most diverse mix of brands and high-street retail with various product categories in the offering mix. This strategy has proved very effective and complements our mixed-use development-based business model.\n\n# Emaar International\n\nInternational markets continue to form a critical part of our growth strategy. Our masterplan-led, marquee project-centred development forms the foundation of our entry into high-potential markets. We will utilise our landbank of 1.3 Bn sq ft and look at mutually beneficial JVs and JDAs for large projects. We are also eager to take our recurring revenue businesses of malls, retail and hospitality to more countries, as their unique brand and service values will help strengthen Emaar\u2019s value proposition.

The charter for the future is to drive growth responsibly and sustainably. For instance, in our Arabian Ranches and Emirates Living properties, innovative technology like ultrasonic algae control devices have been introduced to reduce chemical usage for arresting algae growth. We have already put in place plans and strategies for reducing operational and embodied carbon. Our drive towards more sustainable operations aligns with Dubai\u2019s Green Vision, the UAE\u2019s external commitments, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).\n\n# Governance\n\nWe remain committed to running our organisation in a transparent and accountable way. Accordingly, our Board has approved a new dividend policy that proposes an increasing share of dividends linked to our performance and will make our stakeholders true partners in our success.\n\n# Financial Performance\n\nThe financial year we have just closed has been exceptional in many ways. We have seen tremendous growth in all our segments, with manifold increase in tourist traffic and a strong trade and commerce resurgence.

It achieved record revenues of AED 3.4 Bn and grew over 57% in 2022, compared to the previous year.\n\nThe hospitality business displayed a robust post-pandemic recovery, which was visible across the UAE economy. We achieved strong ADRs and average occupancy levels of 69% in the UAE during the year. ADR growth and cost control countermeasures helped our hospitality business achieve a record EBITDA margin of 50% in 2022 which is significantly higher compared to the pre-pandemic period. Currently, we have 37 hotels (including JVs) with over 8,100 keys and a healthy pipeline of 29 hotels under development, of which more than 2/3 are under management contracts. In 2022, we achieved the historic milestone of reaching 60 hotel projects in our portfolio (including both in-operation and under-development hotels).\n\n# Key numbers\n\n|Contribution to group revenue|13%|\n|---|---|\n|Average occupancy rate in the UAE|69%|\n|Hotel keys|37|\n|Branded apartments|362|\n|Total keys across hospitality portfolio|Over 8,100|\n|Commercial leasing space in Dubai|2.4 Mn sq ft|\n\n# Entertainment & other business\n\n# Hospitality business\n\nRobust growth and superior margins (In AED)\n\nResilient and profitable (In AED Mn)\n\n|66.6%|39.2%|44.6%|\n|---|---|---|\n|67.7%|62.6%|68.6%|\n|60.4%|30.8%|37.8%|\n|30.2%|25.5%|58.7%|\n|58.9%|24.2%|59.4%|\n|24.8%|46.7%|58.3%|\n|22.3%|1,784|1,408|\n|1,681|1,389|1,304|\n|1,677|1,559|1,195|\n|1,291|1,515|1,405|\n|1,390|991|1,391|\n|1,250|899|914|\n|1,119|649|669|\n\n# Revenues - Mn\n\n# EBITDA Margin %\n\n|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Revenues - Mn|EBITDA Margin %|Revenues - Mn|EBITDA Margin %| | | | | | |\n\nEMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1918, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a0e325f-c05a-4359-bb7c-11c84a31f258": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a0e325f-c05a-4359-bb7c-11c84a31f258", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3108a184-ceef-4576-97d5-563eb4984909", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b8c4895395845ad8244637c9b91d9bbd0f3af72914f0e70d128ad61fd5aab96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# VALUE CREATION\n\n# AT EMAAR\n\nTo achieve our purpose, we need to understand our stakeholders.

A lot of high technology goes into maintaining these ambient temperatures. Centralised cooling plants produce chilled water which acts as a heat reducer and is distributed to consumers through a closed piping circuit, or reticulation system. This centralised production and distribution of cooling energy is called District Cooling (DC). Modern, more environment-friendly DC standards prefer using deep seawater as a coolant as it is colder than surface water and can be easily released into the sea after use. Accordingly freshwater use is completely avoided.\n\nEmaar\u2019s properties across Dubai and UAE extensively use district cooling. We own and run Emaar District Cooling (EDC), as a limited liability company providing innovative cooling solutions across key projects in the UAE and Bahrain. Headquartered in Dubai, EDC owns/manages five cooling plants with a combined capacity of 114,800 MT of refrigeration as on 2022, serving both in-house projects and external ones. EDC\u2019s services cover design, construction, commissioning, operation, management and maintenance of complete end-to-end DC plants (DCPs).\n\n# Sustainable district cooling\n\nWe provide high-quality cooling using sustainable, energy-efficient engineering solutions. Our district cooling arm, Emaar District Cooling (EDC) focuses on energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and sustainable equipment procurement. EDC works with the objective of creating a sustainable energy landscape in the UAE and reducing carbon emissions. It is the region\u2019s leading district cooling provider in terms of energy efficiency achievement.\n\n# The innovative approach taken by EDC includes:\n\n- The utilisation of seawater as a coolant in the Emaar Beachfront district cooling plant. This substantially decreases our water consumption carbon footprint.\n- Installation of thermal storage in respective District Cooling Plants to optimise energy and water consumption rates.\n- Construction of a Treated Sewage Effluent Reverse Osmosis (TSE RO) plant in lieu of individual RO plants in Downtown District Cooling scheme.\n- Employing sophisticated water treatment technologies to monitor, control, and minimise corrosion, scaling and bio-fouling in chilled water systems, and to reduce the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease-causing bacteria.\n\nThe high summer temperatures increase the likelihood of such bacteria occurring, and EDC takes a proactive approach through 24x7 automated chemical treatment system to ensure the safety and health of our users.\n\n# For DCPs, efficiency and reliability are the most critical parameters.\n\nScale economies, that emerge from serving many customers, help to keep down costs. But remaining operationally efficient is as important as operations are typically highly energy-intensive. Any improvement in efficiencies thus results in huge savings in running costs. EDC has been a consistent high performer on both these criteria and has received numerous awards, the most recent being District Cooling Utility Provider award, 2022, at CPI\u2019s Climate Control Awards.\n\n# Total District Cooling Energy Consumption in the UAE\n\n|0|87,800 MTCO|eq savings in 2022|\n|---|---|---|\n|18,932|gasoline powered cars driven over one year|Equals carbon sequestered by saplings over a decade|\n|1,452,839| | |\n\nThe Beachfront DCP is housed in the basement of a residential tower and does not require a separate plot, thus saving space. While designing the system aspects like safety, noise levels, anti-corrosive safeguards, isolation chambers, and check valves were integrated to safeguard against discomfort caused by constant vibration from operations, the risk of leaks and seawater flooding, respectively. Operational since mid-2021, the plant is highly efficient in handling high-load capacities and has been recognised for its innovative technology use.\n\nEMAAR PROPERTIES PJSC\n\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4234, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2088cf6d-4adc-4e44-8d0f-88c32d7b8711": {"__data__": {"id_": "2088cf6d-4adc-4e44-8d0f-88c32d7b8711", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6caeeeb2-73b9-4900-a337-7623c735ab2f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "16a354414e95bdf81a5bd8ee1b40bf0723badb3b509831047e466c1d21d14357", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# SOCIAL\n\n# THE WIND BENEATH OUR WINGS\n\nOur employees, customers, suppliers and communities have made Emaar the well-respected brand that it is today through their trust and hard work.

Individual development plans have been developed with varying weightage of 70% for experience, 20% for exposure and 10% for education. Experience is built by shadowing on the job, coaching, mentoring and learning from peers. All Emiratis and critical position holders are on a robust development plan.\n\n# Succession plan\n\nThe L&D team, in conjunction with the Senior Leadership Team, has developed succession plans for division heads, department heads and other key positions that influence Emaar\u2019s growth and sustainability. Key successors have been identified, who have the potential to fulfil these positions. They will be groomed through oversight over their performance management plan.\n\n# Employee engagement initiatives\n\nCreating and maintaining a comfortable, safe and stimulating workplace is the foundation for higher productivity. During the year, several employee engagement initiatives were organised to address our diverse priorities around health and wellbeing, sports and fitness, making the workplace friendly for mothers and helping the needy. We organised blood donation drives, breast cancer awareness sessions and clothes donation drives. The UAE National Day was celebrated with great enthusiasm and saw high participation across all our units. As an organisation that cares for the differing needs of its employees, we have introduced healthy snacks at our caf\u00e9, are providing discounted gym memberships and also providing discounts at daycares for those with young children.\n\n# Addressing employee concerns\n\nWe have mechanisms for investigating reported incidents that ensure issues are addressed appropriately. Our employee policies and code of conduct support these mechanisms and facilitate feedback and complaints through surveys and internal feedback forums. Internal employee surveys also help us to improve on operational, commercial and developmental aspects of the business. Dedicated HR Business Partners are available across business units as a point of contact to oversee and address these issues.\n\n# Health and safety\n\nIt is our objective to create an injury-free workplace, where our people feel safe and well cared for and are motivated to give their best.

We endeavour to comprehend our customers intimately and to create products, facilities and experiences that exceed their expectations. The customer\u2019s relationship with Emaar is a long one, beginning with the search for a home and continuing through the living experience. We endeavour to make this entire journey enjoyable and long-lasting.\n\n# Safety audit\n\nMonthly audits, inspections and on-site health and hygiene checks are conducted to ensure that standards are adhered to.

The launch of the Emaar One app has reduced centre walk-ins, and improved waiting and serving times. Customer Happiness Centres handled 38% more service requests in 2022 than in 2021. Relationship Managers proactively contacted signature clients via phone, email and through in-person meetings to resolve issues before they flare up. These offline and online channels have helped to improve customer satisfaction scores across all business assets. Also these channels have been used for intensive customer pain point monitoring and dissatisfaction scores have YoY reduced by 12% in 2022.\n\n# Community events\n\nWe organised barbecues, movie evenings, game contests joyful festivals to bring our communities together.

By saving natural resources, protecting the environment and becoming more self-sufficient, such communities enjoy a healthier life too. During the year, ECM organised a number of environment-friendly initiatives to drive awareness and promote long-term lifestyle changes.\n\n# Community organic garden\n\nIn 2022, ECM and our landscaping team started the community organic garden project in Dubai Hills Estate, which will be expanded to other communities in 2023. Under this project, the residents received their own organic vegetable and fruit table, which will allow them to maintain a healthy diet.\n\n# Community garden challenge\n\nTo promote community spirit and encourage villa homeowners in Emirates Living, Arabian Ranches I and II, Reem, Polo Homes, Dubai Hills Estate and Emaar South to improve their private gardens, we created the Community Garden Challenge. The villa communities shortlisted 59 entrants per category based on garden sizes of small, medium and large. Community management chose winners from the finalists and their interviews were featured in the community bulletins. Home Garden Competitions will be expanded to apartments in the coming years to promote terrace gardening and the cultivation of homegrown foods.\n\n# Electric vehicle charging units\n\nEmaar Properties is committed to the UAE\u2019s vision of becoming a global leader in green real estate and infrastructure development. With this long-term objective in mind, we installed electric vehicle charging stations in six residential communities to encourage residents to start using electric vehicles, accelerate the transition to green mobility and cut back on emissions. All our upcoming projects will have EV charging facilities.\n\n# Kill the Bill challenge\n\nEmaar Communities\u2019 Kill the Bill Challenge encouraged power and water conservation amongst residents. The project was launched via email blasts and posters, and during the course of the project there was a significant reduction in utility bills of residential units. The one-year period between August 2021 till August 2022 was reviewed as a part of this challenge, and aspects like unit occupancy, change in the number of occupants, and measures taken to reduce usage were considered while evaluating the usage patterns. Top contestants cut utility bills by 54.6%.\n\n# Business through local partners\n\nAs we progress towards integrating our ESG priorities within our supply chain, we are increasing local procurements, and in the process, cutting back on GHG emissions and also strengthening the local economy.

The rapid removal of monetary accommodation and increase in policy rates by central banks to control high inflation are having the desired effect of restraining demand. The slowdown will be more pronounced in the advanced economies while growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to increase after bottoming out in 2022. Growth is expected to pick up in China in 2023 with the full reopening post pandemic-related lockdowns. Similar to global demand, world trade growth is expected to moderate in 2023 to 2.4%, despite an easing of supply bottlenecks, before rising to 3.4% in 2024.\n\nAfter rising sharply over 2021 and much of 2022, global inflation is slowing driven by falling energy and food prices. As per the IMF, oil prices are projected to fall by about 16% in 2023, while non-fuel commodity prices are expected to decline by 6.3%. Increased activity in China may also ease supply chain pressures and keep commodity prices lower. However, given continued underlying inflationary pressures on account of cost increase, tight labour market and resilient consumer demand, interest rates will remain elevated for a longer period of time. Continued proactive and pre-emptive efforts are expected in the global market amid a rapidly evolving market.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2276, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a20b377-517e-47ef-a07f-56c836758d59": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a20b377-517e-47ef-a07f-56c836758d59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88eeb7ed-f77b-40a0-927b-69af2a055ce9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "33126f96fb768e8259728d16feac0862239d6954846d3b06a04b650593b07a2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# 94 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhile there are increasing global economic headwinds of a strong US dollar and interest rates being at 15-year highs, the UAE\u2019s economic outlook remains healthy. The UAE\u2019s fiscal position and ease of doing business are expected to dampen the impact of global macroeconomic conditions. The Government\u2019s strategic measures, including the relaxation of foreign ownership laws and visa reforms, helped the growth momentum continue. The UAE\u2019s economy benefits from solid oil revenues in Abu Dhabi and from the dynamism of a diversified economy in Dubai, notably in tourism, real estate, and transportation sectors. The Middle East region as a whole is more integrated than it has been for years both socially and economically, as seen during the FIFA World Cup, and 2023 is likely to bring significant numbers of youth from other Arab and non-Arab countries. It is also developing its domestic capital market to support growth.\n\n# UAE Economy\n\nThe UAE continues to maintain its status as one of the most competitive and highly advanced economies in the world, leveraging innovative strategies to boost economic growth and diversification. The country\u2019s continued economic growth and progress across major economic development indicators showcase the stability of the UAE\u2019s financial ecosystem and the resilience of the national economy.\n\nOne noteworthy highlight was Dubai\u2019s continued smooth post-pandemic recovery, as evidenced by 6% Q3 2022 GDP growth. Looking ahead, Dubai is projected to play an increasingly significant role in the UAE\u2019s growth due to the recent unveiling of the Dubai government\u2019s AED 32 trillion (US$ 8.7 trillion) economic plan. The UAE economy grew 7.6% in 2022 on the back of easing of COVID restrictions leading to robust tourism, momentum from Expo 2020 Dubai, strong recovery in construction industries, as well as higher oil production. Additionally, global uncertainty led to larger financial inflows, contributing to rapid real estate price growth in some segments. Trade crossed AED 2 trillion and re-exports surpassed AED 600 Bn for the first time ever.\n\n# Economic Indicators\n\n|Year|2019|2020|2021|2022|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|GDP Growth % YoY|2.6|2.6|2.3|3.3|\n|GDP Growth % YoY|(2.9)|(4.5)|(12.4)|(13.5)|\n|Q1| | | | |\n|Q2| | |(18.3)| |\n|Q3|6.0|5.9|6.0|6.0|\n|Q4| | | | |\n\nThe UAE is projected to be the fastest growing country in the Arabian Gulf in 2023 with a real GDP growth rate of 4.2% with moderating inflation and non-oil sector delivering healthy growth.\n\nSource: Haver Analytics, Dubai Statistics Center.

It ended the year with a record of over 97,000 transactions valued at AED 265 Bn, 78% higher than in 2021 (source: Emirates NBD).\n\n# Key Drivers behind Strong Residential Performance in Dubai\n\nDubai\u2019s long held belief of \u2018build and they will come\u2019 is gradually evolving into a \u2018build it and they will come and stay\u2019 philosophy. The city\u2019s appeal stretches right across the world. Adding to the city\u2019s appeal is its relative affordability, with prime homes transacting for around US$ 800 per sq ft, making Dubai one of the most affordable luxury residential markets in the world.\n\n|Sales transactions:|Dubai\u2019s swift Covid recovery|\n|---|---|\n|2022|100|\n| |97.5|\n| |75|\n| |64.8|\n| |55.8|\n| |60.2|\n| |45.1%|\n| |54.9%|\n|Thousands|46.8|\n| |46.5|\n| |50|\n| |41.0|\n| |37.9|\n| |32.5|\n| |37.7|\n| |34.0|\n| |20|\n| |0|\n\nAs per CBRE, in the year ahead, both the average price and rental growth rates in Dubai\u2019s real estate market will remain strong, albeit with a tendency towards moderation. In certain emerging neighbourhoods with ample supply, prices are expected to decline. Despite this, the growth rate for prime markets globally is predicted to remain the highest at 13.5% in 2023. The real estate market\u2019s fundamentals remain unchanged, and a return to stable and sustainable growth will bolster the confidence of homeowners and investors. Overall, city-wide prices remain 21.4% below the last peak in 2014.\n\n# Opportunities and challenges\n\nAs per JLL on the supply side, 38,000 residential units were delivered in Dubai in 2022 compared to the previous year\u2019s 40,000 units and the total residential stock of Dubai was 680,000 units with 41,000 units scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\n# Opportunities\n\n- Improvement in affordability\n- Need for larger spaces\n- Higher foreign investment\n\n# Challenges\n\n- Rising construction cost\n- Inflationary trends\n- Global economic headwinds\n- Rising mortgage rates\n\n# Hospitality Market\n\nBased on data by Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism, there was an impressive 97% YoY increase in international overnight visitors in 2022 compared to 2021. Dubai received 14.4 Mn arrivals, almost reaching the pre-pandemic rate of 16.7 Mn seen in 2019. On top of that, the average hotel occupancy rate stood at 73%, one of the highest in the world and just shy of its 75% level in 2019 prior to the pandemic.\n\n# Dubai Real Estate upcycle\n\nThis positive momentum, despite lower global travel as compared to pre-Covid levels, strengthens Dubai\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s top business and tourism destinations, driving the goal of Dubai Economic Agenda D33.\n\n# Planned deliveries\n\nIn Dubai with the completion of around 6,800 keys in 2022, its hotel stock rose to 148,000 keys with most deliveries comprising four and five-star properties.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict provided an additional challenge to the economy, with Egypt being a net commodity importer, resulting in higher domestic prices and budgetary pressures. Despite this, Egypt\u2019s GDP is projected to remain steady at 4.5% in FY 2023.\n\nEgypt\u2019s strategic monetary tightening, including raising interest rates to 16.2%, has helped to reduce inflation to 24.4% in 2022. Furthermore, the government has provided LE130 Bn in social mitigation packages to protect vulnerable populations from rising prices. The healthy government expenditure to GDP ratio stood at 23.1% in FY 2022 demonstrates the government\u2019s ongoing dedication to addressing the current situation.\n\n# Retail Market\n\nThe retail market is anticipated to grow over the next few years with rising support from tourism and increasing household consumption. The retail property sector was hit hard by the pandemic and the increase in online shopping was thought to keep the sector subdued. On the positive side, the segment showed signs of resilience since the second half of 2021 and rents have stabilised. The demand for retail space is rising in the UAE\u2019s prime locations with average rents for super-regional malls in Dubai up by 3% YoY towards the end of the year, underpinned by increasing tourist footfalls.\n\n# Total retail stock in 2022\n\nRetail Stock\n2.9 Mn sq m\n\nDevelopers continue to add supply given positive market dynamics. The delivery of around 200,000 sq m of retail floorspace last year raised Dubai\u2019s total stock to 4.63 Mn sq m.\n\n# Egyptian Real Estate Sector\n\nReal estate is one of the hottest sectors to invest in Egypt. To improve living standards and appeal to investors, the Egyptian government has invested approximately US$ 400 Bn in infrastructure. It is now looking to increase the size of private sector from 30% to 65% by 2025 in order to increase investments. Growing population and economic expansion will keep the demand in the real estate sector buoyant.\n\n# Residential\n\nIn the residential segment, the total stock stood at 246,000 units at the end of 2022 with completion of 18,000 units for the year, similar to last year, and 35,000 units are expected to be completed in 2023.\n\n# To-be-delivered in 2023\n\n0.4 Mn sq m\n\nRising inflation and currency devaluation has led to a doubling of construction materials costs, causing delays in deliveries and a hike in prices.\n\nThe hospitality and residential sector is recovering, boosted by public and private events and flexible payment plans in the wake of the pandemic and geo-political tensions.\n\nEgypt\u2019s New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) of the Ministry of Housing is currently building 20 fourth-generation cities on a total area of 243,600 hectares, expected to accommodate about 30 Mn people and provide millions of jobs.

The annual inflation rate in India increased to 5.72% in December 2022.\n\n# Indian Real Estate Sector\n\nIndia\u2019s real estate is witnessing a healthy recovery. It contributes about 6-7% to the Indian GDP and is expected to contribute about 13% by 2025. Despite pandemic exigencies, the sector has continued to show resilience and steady growth in 2022. Covid has helped in bringing about a paradigm shift in how customers view residential properties and has reinforced the importance of home ownership. New trends emerged as a result of the pandemic are preference for larger-sized apartments, an inclination towards reputed developers, and a rising demand for township projects.\n\nGovernment policy initiatives like Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) are expected to ramp up demand in residential and commercial real estate. Increasing NRI and FDI investments are also helping boost the office space segment. The real estate industry has witnessed holistic growth across tier I, II & III cities with Tier II cities expected to show more demand backed by increasing employment opportunities.\n\n# Financial Overview\n\n# An overview of the Consolidated Results for 2022\n\n|AED Mn|2022|2021 (Restated)|% YoY Change|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Revenue|24,926|27,896|(11%)|\n|Gross profit|12,587|11,592|9%|\n|Gross profit margin %|50.5%|41.6%|-|\n|EBITDA|9,816|8,309|18%|\n|EBITDA Margin (%)|39.4%|29.8%|-|\n|Net profit*|6,832|3,801|80%|\n|Profit margin (%)|27.4%|13.6%|-|\n|Earnings Per Share (EPS)|0.83|0.52|60%|\n\n*Attributable to Owners\n\n# Important Consolidated KPIs for 2022\n\n|AED 35.1 Bn|AED 24.9 Bn|AED 9.8 Bn|\n|---|---|---|\n|(US$ 9.5 Bn)|(US$ 6.8 Bn)|(US$ 2.7 Bn)|\n|Overall property sales|Revenue|EBITDA|\n|(including sales related to non-consolidated JVs/JDAs)| | |\n\n# Company Overview\n\nEmaar Properties PJSC is one of the world\u2019s most valuable and admired real estate development companies.

The transfer to statutory reserve from the distributable profit has been suspended as the reserve has reached 50% of the paid-up share capital. However, during the year, in compliance with applicable UAE Federal Law, AED 3,091 million has been credited to statutory reserve, being the excess of agreed value of the Company\u2019s shares over the nominal value per share issued to Dubai Holding Group as part consideration for acquisition of Dubai Creek harbour LLC by the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has proposed a cash dividend of 25% of share capital, which is subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.

The conditions precedent (CPs) for the aforesaid transaction were satisfied on 8 December 2022 and DCH is consolidated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as at 31 December 2022.\n\nAccounting for acquisition has involved significant judgment in order to:\n\n- determine whether the acquisition constitutes a business or is in the nature of an asset acquisition;\n- identify and measure the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and\n- allocate the purchase consideration.\n\nAccordingly, due to the factors noted above and that the transaction represents a material acquisition for the Group, this is considered as a key audit matter.\n\n# How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\n- Obtained and reviewed the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d) to obtain an understanding of terms of the transaction, appropriate approvals and authorization and key conditions mentioned therein;\n- Inspected minutes of meetings of Investment Committee, the Board of Directors and Shareholders to ensure appropriate approvals, including regulatory approvals of the transaction;\n- Inspected the report by a management appointed external valuer on determination of value of assets in DCH;\n- We have evaluated the qualifications and competence of the external valuer and read the terms of engagement of the valuers with the Group to determine whether there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or limited the scope of their work;\n- Obtained and assessed management conclusion on accounting for acquisition of DCH and evaluated the conclusion that the transaction is an asset acquisition as the definition of business is not met against the principles of IFRS 3 Business Combinations;\n- Assessed appropriateness of allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities of DCH, based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition;\n- We involved our real estate valuation specialist, who on a sample basis, reviewed valuation methodologies used in the valuation of non-financial assets acquired and challenged assumptions for key estimates of sales price, cost to complete, market rent, future rental income, operating costs, occupancy rate, discount rates, capitalization and terminal yield rates used in the valuation by comparing them against historical rates and available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors;\n- We have assessed the adequacy of the disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

report.\n\n# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Standards, and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Decree Law No. 32 of 2021 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the

Company (the \u201cCompany\u201d) was established as a public joint stock company by Ministerial Decree number 66 in the year 1997. The Company was established on 23 June 1997 and commenced operations on 29 July 1997. The Company and its subsidiaries constitute the Group (the \u201cGroup\u201d). The Company\u2019s registered office is at P.O. Box 9440, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d).\n\nThe shares of the Company are traded on the Dubai Financial Market.\n\nThe principal activities of the Group are property investment, development and development management, shopping malls and retail, hospitality, property management and utility services and investments in providers of financial services.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue on 16 March 2023.\n\n# Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where all the following criteria are met:\n\n1. the Group has power over an entity (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);\n2. the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and\n3. the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the Company\u2019s returns.\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- The Group\u2019s voting rights and potential voting rights\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\n# Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition or incorporation, being the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4152, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0a995df-e683-430c-9f9c-96eaa87def71": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0a995df-e683-430c-9f9c-96eaa87def71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8afacbb2-46f7-44ac-a51d-3156af847ee0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "adafab0b83d6014cf3a40ef3bee5eb971603cce3679752dbc84afa2038b04d92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95b2232f-aeb1-4a07-b785-5eb6940fe3b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a1dd19fc4bc4080f079bb9dfbc792bff3040867e8af108d7539ed177d382c20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# 156 Financial statements\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n# As at 31 December 2022\n\nReporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\n\n- Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;\n- Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;\n- Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity;\n- Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;\n- Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;\n- Recognises any surplus or deficit in the consolidated income statement; and\n- Reclassifies the Group\u2019s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement or retained earnings, as appropriate.\n\nDetails of the Company\u2019s significant subsidiaries as at 31 December 2022 are as follows:\n\n|Subsidiary|Place of incorporation|Principal activities|Percentage of effective interest|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Emaar Hospitality Group LLC|UAE|Providing hospitality services|100.00%|\n|Dubai Hills Retail LLC|UAE|Property development and management of leasing| |\n|Emaar Malls Management LLC and its subsidiaries (refer note (b) below)|UAE|Retail development and management of shopping malls|100.00%|\n|Emaar Development PJSC and its subsidiaries|UAE|Property development and development management|80.16%|\n|Emaar Entertainment LLC|UAE|Leisure and entertainment activities|100.00%|\n|Emaar Hotels & Resorts Group|UAE|Providing hospitality services|100.00%|\n|Dubai Creek Harbour LLC and its subsidiaries (refer note (a) below)|UAE|Property development and development management|100.00%|\n|Emaar Misr for Development SAE and its subsidiaries|Arab Republic of Egypt|Property investment and development|88.74%|\n|Emaar Middle East LLC|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|Property investment and development|100.00%|\n|Emaar Properties Gayrimenkul Gelistirme Anonim Sirketi|Republic of Turkey|Property investment and development|100.00%|\n|Emaar Libadiye Gayrimenkul Gelistirme A.S.|Republic of Turkey|Property investment and development, development of retail, shopping malls and hospitality assets|100.00%|\n|Emaar India Limited and its subsidiaries|India|Property investment and development|77.01%|\n\na) During October 2013, the Company and Dubai Holding Group (DH) entered into a joint development agreement (JDA) to develop Dubai Creek Harbour (\u2018DCH\u2019), a residential, retail and commercial real estate development. Pursuant to the JDA, Emaar was to operate and manage the business of DCH.\n\nDuring the current year, Emaar and DH undertook discussions and agreed for the acquisition of the DCH development by Emaar, which was announced on 11 August 2022, for a consideration of AED 7.5 billion, payment of which will be as follows:\n\n1. Cash consideration of AED 3,750 million, of which AED 2,500 million will be paid on closing of the transaction (paid in December 2022) and balance AED 1,250 million will be paid in a deferred manner over a period of three years (also refer note 20);\n2.

Unrealised gains resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in the associates and joint ventures. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n# Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nThe Group recognises income from turnover rent on the basis of audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties\n\nThe Group hires the services of external professionally qualified valuers to obtain estimates of the market value of investment properties using recognised valuation techniques for the purposes of their impairment review and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Classification of investment properties\n\nThe Group determines whether a property qualifies as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property. In making its judgement, the Group considers whether the property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by the Group. The Group has determined that hotels and serviced apartment buildings owned by the Group are to be classified as part of property, plant and equipment rather than investment properties since the Group also operates these assets.\n\n# Consolidation of subsidiaries\n\nThe Group has evaluated all the investee entities including special purpose entities to determine whether it controls the investee as per the criteria laid out by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group has evaluated, amongst other things, its ownership interest, the contractual arrangements in place and its ability and the extent of its involvement with the relevant activities of the investee entities to determine whether it controls the investee.\n\n# Operating leases - Group as lessor\n\nThe Group has entered into commercial and retail property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and so accounts for the contracts as operating leases.\n\n# Hyperinflation\n\nTurkey became a hyperinflationary economy in 2022. Management has carried out a detailed assessment of the impact of applying IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and noted that there is no impact of applying IAS 29 on its operations in Turkey, as the functional and presentation currency of the component is US Dollars.\n\n# Retrospective change in classification of investments\n\nDuring the current period, based on review of contractual terms and arrangement with the other shareholder, management has re-evaluated its assessment on control over an entity, previously classified as a subsidiary and concluded that both the shareholders have joint control over the relevant business activities. Accordingly, it had retrospectively applied the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.\n\n# Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n# Judgements\n\nThe key judgements and estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group are discussed below:\n\n# Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations\n\nThe Group is required to assess each of its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time in order to recognise revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nIn cases where the Group determines that performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, revenue is recognised when control over the asset that is the subject of the contract is transferred to the customer. In the case of contracts to sell real estate assets this is generally when the consideration for the unit has been substantially received and there are no impediments in the handing over of the unit to the customer. The title will be transferred to the customer only upon 100% collection, resulting in a low risk of default and loss thereof.\n\n# Transfer of real estate assets from property, plant and equipment to development properties\n\nThe Group sells real estate assets in its ordinary course of business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5569, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fef7ec11-ed86-4bbc-a0a5-8519fac37ab4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fef7ec11-ed86-4bbc-a0a5-8519fac37ab4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19526477-7fbd-49ec-9225-5ce38db9dd49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "858b9da61c3bfc8834526171c336f0303e3fa7c41a74b3574e55c37d192e49db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de447b77-92b2-4777-8705-02f2471d6d9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0b3e1e025f66a29200db51ff29e68b394cc84b809603d518f9ba2964438c75a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In cases where the Group determines that performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, revenue is recognised when control over the asset that is the subject of the contract is transferred to the customer.

When the real estate assets which were previously classified as property, plant and equipment are identified for sale in the ordinary course of business, then the assets are transferred to development properties at their carrying value at the date of identification. Sale proceeds from such assets are recognised as revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n# Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nThe Group determines

option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4844, "end_char_idx": 6310, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template":

Financial Performance Report\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n# As at 31 December 2022\n\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.\n\nThe Group\u2019s management determines the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering the expected usage of the asset or physical wear and tear. The management periodically reviews estimated useful lives and the depreciation / amortisation method to ensure that the method and period of depreciation / amortisation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n# Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. The non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and chooses a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\n# Measurement of progress when revenue is recognised over time\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the input method to measure the progress of performance obligations where revenue is recognised over time. The Group considers that the use of the input method which requires revenue recognition on the basis of the Group\u2019s efforts to the satisfaction of the performance obligation provides the best reference of revenue actually earned. In applying the input method, the Group estimates the cost to complete the projects in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised.\n\n# Cost to complete the projects\n\nThe Group estimates the cost to complete the projects in order to determine the cost attributable to revenue being recognised. These estimates include the cost of providing infrastructure, potential claims by contractors as evaluated by the project consultant and the cost of meeting other contractual obligations to the customers.\n\n# Taxes\n\nThe Group is subject to income and capital gains taxes in certain jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required to determine the total provision for current and deferred taxes. The Group established provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provision is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.\n\n# Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n# 2.3 Changes in the Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\nA number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n\n|Forthcoming requirements|Effective date|\n|---|---|\n|Definition of accounting estimates, amendments to IAS 8|1 January 2023|\n|Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)|1 January 2023|\n|IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts|1 January 2023|\n|Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)|1 January 2023|\n|Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)|1 January 2023|\n|Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)|1 January 2024|\n|Transition, effective date and due process (Agenda Paper 12C)| |\n|Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor its Associates or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)|Effective date deferred indefinitely|\n\n# 2.4 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n# Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers: The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five step model as set out in IFRS.\n\n1.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5241, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "196acb5f-ac29-4666-aa03-249e21752fc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "196acb5f-ac29-4666-aa03-249e21752fc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b203816f-3db4-45be-a407-3919336c8d37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b379601cdc2bdf5a50709e2e6ee3d36a1a3fd4665e7ab4c6e45ebe4dba0f40b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b070cccc-35fb-48f6-b309-8b49115601f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a54a0102b4c8a478af3cc5370ec5d401c6e035c91c835b7e784f088a5af7de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.

Determine the transaction price:\n\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\nThe Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements.\n\nRevenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.\n\n# Step 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract:\n\nFor a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.\n\n# Step 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nThe Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:\n\n1. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group\u2019s performance as the Group performs; or\n2. The Group\u2019s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or\n3. The Group\u2019s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nFor performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n# Customer loyalty programme\n\nThe Group operates a loyalty points programme, \u2018U by Emaar\u2019, which allows customers to accumulate points when they spend in any of the Group\u2019s hotel or leisure units. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as they provide a material right to the customer. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative stand-alone selling price and recognised as a contract liability until the points are redeemed.\n\n# Lease to buy scheme\n\nSales under the lease to buy scheme are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Rental income during the period of lease is accounted for on a straight-line basis until such time the lessee exercises its option to purchase;\n- When the lessee exercises its option to purchase, a sale is recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policy for sale of property as stated above; and\n- When recognising the sale, revenue is the amount payable by the lessee at the time of exercising the option to acquire the property.\n\n# Revenue recognition for turnover rent\n\nIncome from turnover rent is recognised based on the audited turnover reports submitted by the tenants. In the absence of audited reports, management makes its own assessment about the tenants achieving or exceeding the stipulated turnover in the lease contracts based on their historical performance.\n\n# Income tax\n\nTaxation is provided in accordance with the relevant fiscal regulations of the countries in which the Group operates. Current tax is the expected tax payable/receivable on taxable income/loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted as at the reporting date, and adjustments to the tax receivable/payable in respect of prior years.\n\nIncome tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the consolidated income statement.\n\n# Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets or investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group\u2019s other accounting policies.\n\n# Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5181, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab9a01bc-85b5-458f-8725-7247dec0ae10": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab9a01bc-85b5-458f-8725-7247dec0ae10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "934c67d2-7ec3-4d02-aabb-f12304bdb557", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eba2290741f282a640e6b371f81e2e069b67a7c0fe06b68e193edb069e166c28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "178e8abb-b416-46ce-afe3-baef21600420", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4edb94a2c39d17b96c64e2076e920d5a8be1af9926aad53627d696c91d25ec5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# 166 Financial statements\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n# As at 31 December 2022\n\n+ in respect of deductible temporary differences that are critical for entities to determine their tax status associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe Group has determined that the Law was not practically operational as at 31 December 2022 and, hence, not enacted or substantively enacted from the perspective of IAS 12 Income Taxes. The Group will continue to monitor the timing of the issuance of these critical Cabinet Decisions to determine its tax status and the applicability of IAS 12 \u2013 Income Taxes.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n# Global minimum tax\n\nIn December 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a draft legislative framework, followed by detailed guidance release in March 2022, that is expected to be used by 135 individual jurisdictions, including the UAE, that signed the agreement to amend their local tax laws to align with global minimum tax. Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates are enacted or substantively enacted, the Group may be subject to the top-up tax. Management is monitoring the progress of the legislative process in each jurisdiction the Group operates. Based on the limited information available and current regulations there are no quantitative impact for the current period.\n\n# Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Leasehold improvements|2 - 15 years|\n|---|---|\n|Sales centres (included in land and buildings)| |\n|Buildings|10 - 45 years|\n|Computers and office equipment|2 - 5 years|\n|Plant, machinery and heavy equipment|3 - 20 years|\n|Motor vehicles|3 - 5 years|\n|Furniture and fixtures|2 - 10 years|\n|Leisure, entertainment and other assets|2 - 25 years|\n\nNo depreciation is charged on land and capital work-in-progress. The useful lives, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed periodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\nThe Federal Decree-Law No (47) of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses (referred as \u201cCorporate Tax Law\u201d) was issued by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 9 December 2022. The Corporate tax law provides the legislative basis for the introduction and implementation of a Federal Corporate Tax (\u201cCorporate tax\u201d) in the UAE and is effective for the financial years starting on or after 1 June 2023.\n\nHowever, there are a number of significant decisions that are yet to be finalized by way of a Cabinet Decision.\n\n# Investment properties\n\nProperties held for rental or capital appreciation purposes are classified as investment properties.

Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Buildings|10 - 45 years|\n|---|---|\n|Furniture, fixtures and others|4 - 10 years|\n|Plant and equipment|3 - 10 years|\n\nNo depreciation is charged on land and capital work-in-progress. The useful lives, depreciation method and residual value method are reviewed periodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets.\n\nProperties are transferred from investment properties to development properties when and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by commencement of development with a view to sell. Such transfers are made at the carrying value of the properties at the date of transfer.\n\nThe Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment properties are impaired. Whenever the carrying amount of an investment property exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of investment property\u2019s fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.\n\nReversal of impairment losses recognised in the prior years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised for the investment properties no longer exist or have reduced.\n\n# Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term up to 35 years. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n# Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the estimated useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.\n\nAmortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n|Customers relationship|5 years|\n|---|---|\n|Software|3 years|\n\nGoodwill and Brand is not amortised.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the asset is derecognised.\n\n# Development Properties\n\nProperties acquired, constructed or in the course of construction for sale in the ordinary course of business are classified as development properties and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes:\n\n- Freehold and leasehold rights for land;\n- Amounts paid to contractors for construction; and\n- Borrowing costs, planning and design costs, costs of site preparation, professional fees for legal services.\n\nThe cost of development properties recognised in the consolidated income statement on sale is determined with reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non-specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.\n\nThe management reviews the carrying values of the development properties on an annual basis.\n\n# Inventories\n\nInventories represent consumables and other goods relating to hospitality and retail business segments of the Group. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.\n\nCosts are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on disposal or completion.\n\n# Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nThe consolidated income statement reflects the Group\u2019s share of the results of operations of its associates and joint ventures after tax and non-controlling interests of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the other comprehensive income or equity of an associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.\n\nUpon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any differences between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When the remaining investment in joint venture constitutes significant influence, it is accounted for as an investment in associate.\n\n# Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n# Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.

The EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.\n\nIf the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in consolidated income statement.\n\n# Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.\n\nThe ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised as other expense and the ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is recognised in other operating income or expenses.\n\nThe Group designates only the spot element of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward element is recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity under cost of hedging reserve.\n\nThe amounts accumulated in consolidated statement of comprehensive income are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.\n\n# Financial assets\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date when the purchase or sale of a financial asset is made under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are initially measured at cost, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. Trade and unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\n# Debt instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices for assets and offer prices for liabilities, at the close of business on the reporting date. If quoted market prices are not available, reference can also be made to broker or dealer price quotations.\n\nThe fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with credit institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments at the reporting date.\n\n# Classification of financial assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\u2019s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group\u2019s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are \u2018solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\u2019 on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nFor the purposes of classifying financial assets, an instrument is an \u2018equity instrument\u2019 if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of \u2018equity\u2019 for the issuer (under IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation) except for certain non-derivative puttable instruments presented as equity by the issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are \u2018debt instruments\u2019.\n\n# Equity investments\n\nAll financial assets that are equity investments are measured at fair value either through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss.

For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\n# Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or, when applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:\n\n- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n- The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement, and\n- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either:\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset.\n\n# Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.\n\n# Trade and other payables\n\nLiabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not.\n\n# Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating leases, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The average rate applied is 4% to 8%.\n\n# Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n# Loans and borrowings\n\nTerm loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.\n\n# Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets.\n\n# Sukuk\n\nThe sukuk are stated at amortised cost using the effective profit rate method. Profit attributable to the sukuk is calculated by applying the prevailing market profit rate at the time of issue, for similar sukuk instruments and any difference with the profit distributed is added to the carrying amount of the sukuk. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability component.\n\n# End-of-service benefits\n\nThe Group provides end-of-service benefits to its employees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually based upon the employees\u2019 final salary and length of service, subject to the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment.\n\n# Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.\n\n# Foreign currency translations\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in AED which is the functional currency of the Company.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into AED at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n# Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as investment in securities and hedges, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\n# Fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- Level 1 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in an active market (that are unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- Level 3 \u2013 Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n# Segment Information\n\nManagement monitors the operating results of its investment in securities and hedges, at fair value at each reporting date. For management purposes, the Group is organised into three major segments, namely, real estate (develop, sell and manage condominiums, villas, commercial units and plots of land), leasing, retail and related activities (develop, lease and manage malls, retail, commercial and residential spaces) and hospitality (develop, own and/or manage hotels, serviced apartments and leisure). Other segments include businesses that individually do not meet the criteria for a reportable segment as per IFRS 8 Operating Segments. These businesses are property management and utility services and investments in providers of financial services.\n\nRevenue from sources other than property sales, leasing, retail and related activities and hospitality are included in other operating income.\n\n# Geographic segments\n\nThe Group is currently operating in a number of countries outside the UAE and is engaged in the development of several projects which have significant impact on the Group results. The domestic segment includes business activities and operations in the UAE and the international segment includes business activities and operations outside the UAE (including export sales).",

shareholders of the Company in the general meeting held on 21 September 2022 have approved to sell the entire share capital of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, Namshi Holding Limited (\u2018Namshi\u2019) to Noon AD Holdings Limited, a related party of the Group, for a cash consideration of AED 1,231,190 thousands (US$ 335,200 thousands). The transaction completion was subject to satisfactory completion of certain conditions precedence, including requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the requisite authority approval was not received, accordingly the assets and liabilities pertaining to Namshi have been classified as held for sale and measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

Gross margins - Gross margins were based on the expectations of management based on past experience and expectation of future market conditions.\n2. Discount rates - Discount rates reflected management\u2019s estimate of the specific risks. The discount rate was based on the risk-free rate of the investment\u2019s country, market risk premium related to the industry and individual unit related risk premium/ discount. This was the benchmark used by management to assess performance and to evaluate future investment proposals. Management estimated that such discount rate to be used for evaluation of the investment should be between 7.5% to 17% (2021: 7% to 12.6%).\n3. Growth rate estimates - Management prepared a five-year budget based on their expectations of future results, thereafter a growth rate of 1% to 4% (2021: 0.5% to 22%) was assumed based on the nature of CGUs.\n\nWith regard to the assessment of value in use of the goodwill, management believes that no reasonably possible change in a key assumption would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to materially exceed its recoverable amount.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2684, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8bb02b9-7daa-4113-806d-f31027fabb28": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8bb02b9-7daa-4113-806d-f31027fabb28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fc3b377-069d-4e52-b7f7-7b1e5b4f67c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f19d2da602568f2836726d398e11f0d70ef6d92151e8d6fca9a9c27fa3a5523", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Financial Statements\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n# As at 31 December 2022\n\n# 21 Advances from Customers\n\n| |2022|2021| |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| |AED\u2019000|AED\u2019000 (Restated)| |\n|Balance at the beginning of the year|13,791,499|11,689,423| |\n|Effect of restatement (note 2.2)|(7,993)|(8,640)| |\n|Balance at the beginning of the year (Restated)|13,783,506|11,680,783| |\n|Additions during the year|27,178,662|27,086,150| |\n|Revenue recognised during the year|(21,697,229)|(24,976,553)| |\n|Acquired on acquisition of DCH (note 2.1)|1,669,776|-| |\n|Foreign currency translation differences|(1,370,986)|(6,874)| |\n|Balance at the end of the year|19,563,729|13,783,506| |\n\nThe aggregate amount of the sale price allocated to the performance obligations of the Group that are fully or partially unsatisfied as at 31 December 2022 is AED 52,038,986 thousands (excluding joint ventures) (31 December 2021 (Restated): AED 40,197,341 thousands).

Group\u2019s senior management are responsible for developing and monitoring the Group\u2019s risk management policies and report regularly to the Board of Directors on their activities.\n\nThe Group\u2019s current financial risk management framework is a combination of formally documented risk management policies in certain areas and informal risk management policies in others. The Group\u2019s risk management policies (both formal and informal) are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group\u2019s activities.\n\nThe Group\u2019s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group\u2019s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and adhoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise interest-bearing loans and borrowings, sukuk, retentions payable and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group\u2019s operations.\n\nThe Group has various financial assets such as bank balances and cash, trade and unbilled receivables, investment in securities, loan to joint ventures and associates and other receivables and deposits, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below:\n\n# a) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk principally from its receivables from customers, other receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. Total financial assets at amortised cost amounted to AED 46,244,961 thousands (2021 (restated): AED 36,153,163 thousands) as at the reporting date.\n\n# Trade, unbilled and other receivables\n\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group\u2019s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk. The Group earns its revenues from a large number of customers spread across different geographical segments. However, geographically 98% (2021: 96%) of the Group\u2019s trade and unbilled receivables are based in Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts for the sale of residential and commercial units and plots of land on an instalment basis. The instalments are specified in the contracts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4760, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8940e221-5334-41d2-a324-f26b9e7da631": {"__data__": {"id_": "8940e221-5334-41d2-a324-f26b9e7da631", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13e99198-032e-49bf-9ca5-f8cfef1a757d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b69f3a54c09f89c33a73aa2d52d0714cf7d1634fc7e0cb4174184786cd35b55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fea042f2-75f2-4f80-a058-a6f363522e9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "198a40b43f2f13739631bc5968164efd3916bde804ddb1d2d9129709ac963d25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Total financial assets at amortised cost amounted to AED 46,244,961 thousands (2021 (restated): AED 36,153,163 thousands) as at the reporting date.\n\n# Trade, unbilled and other receivables\n\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group\u2019s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk. The Group earns its revenues from a large number of customers spread across different geographical segments. However, geographically 98% (2021: 96%) of the Group\u2019s trade and unbilled receivables are based in Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts for the sale of residential and commercial units and plots of land on an instalment basis. The instalments are specified in the contracts. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of instalments due. However, the legal ownership of residential, commercial units and plots of land is transferred to the buyer only after all the instalments are recovered. In addition, instalment dues are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group\u2019s exposure to bad debts is not significant.\n\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment at each reporting date that represents its estimate of expected credit losses in respect of trade, unbilled and other receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group has calibrated the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\n\n# Other financial assets and cash deposits\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise bank balances and cash, investment in securities, loans to associates and joint ventures, other receivables and deposits, the Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets.\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by Group\u2019s treasury in accordance with the Group\u2019s policy. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only placing balances with international banks and local banks of good repute. Given the profile of its bankers, management does not expect any counterparty to fail in meeting its obligations.\n\n# Guarantees\n\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to its subsidiaries and certain associates and joint ventures.

Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.\n\nIn order to avoid excessive concentration of risk, the Group\u2019s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio.
